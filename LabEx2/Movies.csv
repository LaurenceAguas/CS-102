"The Gentelmen","Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully","jtindahouse","Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.","13 September 2020","9/10"
"The Gentelmen","That's Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!","planktonrules","Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films.

While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, ""Swept Away"", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is.

"The Gentelmen","A Pure masterpiece","GusherPop","Guy Ritchie's ""The Gentlemen"" plays like a tall tale, filled with exaggerations and embellishments, where the storyteller expects you to pay his bar tab at the end. The narrator is a conniving private detective named Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who sets out to blackmail everyone with a screenplay he's written. The screenplay is called ""BUSH,"" bush being a euphemism for ""marijuana"" and is a complicated tale about the ""turf war"" in the marijuana business. The ""bush"" double entendre is also present, just for the chuckles factor. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American who sees an opportunity in the languishing English aristocracy. He is married to Roz (Michelle Dockery), a ""Cockney cleopatra"" who runs an auto body shop with only women mechanics. Mickey loves his wife and is ready to retire from the weed business. Two rivals emerge as potential buyers: an American Jewish billionaire and a Chinese-Cockney gangster named Dry Eye. Colin Farrell's ""Coach"" is an Irish guy who runs a boxing club. Mickey's right-hand man is Ray (Charlie Hunnan), a mild-mannered man who looks like a desk clerk until you see him in action. The ""gentlemen"" of the title is clearly meant sarcastically. Hugh Grant gives an extraordinary performance in ""The Gentlemen"". The script, which Ritchie co-wrote with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, plays around with genre tropes, but the overriding structure is Fletcher ""pitching"" his script to an increasingly horrified Ray. This ""pitch"" goes on for the entirety of the film, and so as scenes unfold, it is as though the scenes emanate from Fletcher's imagination, when in reality we are seeing what really happened. Guy Ritchie's latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American interloper and marijuana dealer who wants out of the game. He hopes to liquidate his weed-farm empire, and interested buyers include Jewish-American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) and Chinese mobster ""Dry Eye"" (Crazy Rich Asians' Henry Golding). We learn of Mickey's plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant). The screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which Fletcher hopes to exploit Mickey. Ritchie's signature sweary patter is enjoyable, except for the racism, which is especially pointed given the racial delineation of the film's heroes and villains. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those tabloid ""writers"" who loves to be ""in"" on things, and sees people and their reputations as disposable. The entire script is a script within a script, and this is its ace in the hole: there is always one layer between us and the characters. Hugh Grant has become a formidable character actor in the last couple of years, taking full advantage of his options. The one-two punch of ""Paddington 2"" and ""A Very English Scandal"" is a perfect example of this, as Grant is using all of these other acting muscles he normally hadn't been asked to use, and he's thrilling in a role which is mostly exposition. There's one moment where he puts his hand on Hunnam's knee, realizes it's an unwelcome touch, and goes into this wild pop-eyed, ""Oopsie #sorrynotsorry"" facial expression. It's his favorite kind of humor, character-based, behavior-based, and he acts as his own gravitational force. Mickey Pearson may be the lead, but it's Fletcher who gets the last word.","1 September 2020","10/10"

"The Gentelmen","A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!","eelen-seth","This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.","2 January 2020","9/10"

We learn of Mickey's plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant). The screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which Fletcher hopes to exploit Mickey. Ritchie's signature sweary patter is enjoyable, except for the racism, which is especially pointed given the racial delineation of the film's heroes and villains. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those tabloid ""writers"" who loves to be ""in"" on things, and sees people and their reputations as disposable.

Hugh Grant has become a formidable character actor in the last couple of years, taking full advantage of his options. The one-two punch of ""Paddington 2"" and ""A Very English Scandal"" is a perfect example of this, as Grant is using all of these other acting muscles he normally hadn't been asked to use, and he's thrilling in a role which is mostly exposition. There's one moment where he puts his hand on Hunnam's knee, realizes it's an unwelcome touch, and goes into this wild pop-eyed, ""Oopsie #sorrynotsorry"" facial expression. It's his favorite kind of humor, character-based, behavior-based, and he acts as his own gravitational force.

"Killers of The Flower Moon","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of The Flower Moon","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.","2 January 2024","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of The Flower Moon","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.","2 January 2024","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of The Flower Moon","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of The Flower Moon","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message.

For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of The Flower Moon","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of The Flower Moon","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of The Flower Moon","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Saltburn","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10"
"Saltburn","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"

"Saltburn","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"

"Saltburn","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"

And my God this is a tedious film to try to get through! The so-called twist at the end is anything but. There's absolutely no reward at the end for sticking with this grotesque and uninteresting film. The suspenseful bits aren't suspenseful. The funny bits aren't funny and the sexy bits aren't sexy. The only thing the film maker succeeded at was making the grotesque parts nauseatingly grotesque. There's not one interesting nor sympathetic character in the bunch.

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

"Saltburn","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10"
"Saltburn","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"

"Saltburn","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"

"Saltburn","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10"
"Saltburn","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"

Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here.

"All of Us Are Strangers","Metaphysical Tearjerker","evanston_dad","Ok, I feel like I have to go back and watch this one again already after reading some interpretations of the ending. I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. ""All of Us Strangers"" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It's one of the year's best, bar none.","24 February 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s. Rarely has the maligned pop music of this decade come into its own more than in this masterpiece.I will never forget this film.","29 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","I have questions and concerns and yet it's the most moving movie I've seen in years.","tom-640","All of Us Strangers is filled with beautiful lines like that which is one of the main reasons it's such an emotional film. Exploring how moving on is such an important part of dealing with a traumatic experience, and often the hardest part. It's designed to warm the heart almost as many times as it'll break it.Andrew Scott portrays his character's sadness and quietness in such a natural fashion, making every emotional moment that much more impactful.

"All of Us Are Strangers","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"

"All of Us Are Strangers","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","The film is a devastating look at one man's loneliness. Andrew Scott is giving a brilliant performance. With a simple facial expression, he can tell an entire story. He is one of the best actors around. (Scott, Mescal, Bale, Day Lewis -all great all non-American. Where are the great young American actors? But I digress..)
Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it.

"All of Us Are Strangers","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it?

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. ""All of Us Strangers"" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It's one of the year's best, bar none.","24 February 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s. Rarely has the maligned pop music of this decade come into its own more than in this masterpiece.I will never forget this film.","29 January 2024","10/10"

The soundtrack is full of ideal choices but the final song is particularly devastating.","27 January 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"

"All of Us Are Strangers","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","The film is a devastating look at one man's loneliness. Andrew Scott is giving a brilliant performance. With a simple facial expression, he can tell an entire story. He is one of the best actors around. (Scott, Mescal, Bale, Day Lewis -all great all non-American. Where are the great young American actors? But I digress..)
Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it.

"All of Us Are Strangers","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it?

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. ""All of Us Strangers"" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It's one of the year's best, bar none.","24 February 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s. Rarely has the maligned pop music of this decade come into its own more than in this masterpiece.I will never forget this film.","29 January 2024","10/10"

"All of Us Are Strangers","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Loneliness, depression and coping with it all in such a beautiful way.","malmevik77","How is this not nominated for Oscar's is a major snub! One of the sweetest films about a gay couple and haunting vibes mashed in so well. Andrew Haigh directed All of Us Strangers with great ambience, wholesome sensations, and charm; it's a shame it's not a more known movie from numerous people I've mentioned it too. I love how the first half is tranquil, the rest is somber it will hit you with plenty of feels. Andrew Scott and Paul Mascal seem down to earth I'm sure they are a delight to be around. So glad this has a 8.1 rating on IMDb that's very well deserved and I hope more find out about this lovely drama overtime.","25 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","The film is a devastating look at one man's loneliness. Andrew Scott is giving a brilliant performance. With a simple facial expression, he can tell an entire story. He is one of the best actors around. (Scott, Mescal, Bale, Day Lewis -all great all non-American. Where are the great young American actors? But I digress..)
Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it. But I leave that for the viewer to determine. Do not miss!","29 October 2023","9/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it? What did you think?","10 February 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Are Strangers","Wish I enjoyed this as much others!","ta-98251","Had the privilege of catching this film early as it screened at the London Film Festival. I had high hopes after seeing the critics reviews and it did not disappoint.The story follows Adam and his neighbour Harry, with whom he develops a romantic relationship with, as he deals with the grief from his parents tragic death when he was child.The film cuts across genres. At times it is funny, sad, romantic, and even horrifying. It is a damning depiction of the loneliness epidemic among younger men while also dealing with the added challenges faced by those within the lgbt community in trying to fit in.The chemistry between Scott and Mescal is brilliant, while Foy and Bell really hit the right note in their roles. The film is also beautifully shot and has a lovely palette of colours within.It's a tough watch and left me with a lump in my throat for the entire final third, but it thoroughly deserves all the praise it has received so far.9/10.","18 December 2023","5/10"
"One Day","Love story of the year!","achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","16 October 2011","8/10"

"One Day","By sticking to the novel, the movie loses the connection to the characters","napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","14 September 2011","6/10"
"One Day","A growing older movie","Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","31 August 2011","10/10"
"One Day","'One Day' is an achievement in film acting and a beautiful love story","TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","31 August 2011","7/10"
"One Day","A pleasant movie if not quite working as well as it had potential to","TheLittleSongbird","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","3 September 2011","10/10"
"One Day","Lovely, just lovely.... Anne Hathaway does it again!","JimmyCollins","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","19 August 2011","9/10"
"One Day","Better than I had anticipated","queen_of_naboo88","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","3 September 2011","9/10"
"One Day","Too many bitter reviewers...","guest_pabby","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","21 August 2011","4/10"
"One Day","Not Again Next Year, Please","ferguson-6","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","27 January 2012","5/10"

Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels.

"One Day","'One Day' is an achievement in film acting and a beautiful love story","TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","31 August 2011","7/10"

Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind.

"One Day","Lovely, just lovely....

The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","19 August 2011","9/10"
"One Day","Better than I had anticipated","queen_of_naboo88","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","3 September 2011","9/10"
"One Day","Too many bitter reviewers...","guest_pabby","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","21 August 2011","4/10"

The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook.

"One Day","Love story of the year!","achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","16 October 2011","8/10"

And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","19 August 2011","9/10"
"One Day","By sticking to the novel, the movie loses the connection to the characters","napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience.

And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","16 October 2011","8/10"

And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it.

"One Day","By sticking to the novel, the movie loses the connection to the characters","napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience.

Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels.

"One Day","'One Day' is an achievement in film acting and a beautiful love story","TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","31 August 2011","7/10"

What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them.

"One Day","Better than I had anticipated","queen_of_naboo88","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","3 September 2011","9/10"
"One Day","Too many bitter reviewers...","guest_pabby","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","21 August 2011","4/10"
"One Day","Not Again Next Year, Please","ferguson-6","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","27 January 2012","5/10"
"One Day","Love story of the year!","achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations?

Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","21 August 2011","4/10"
"One Day","Not Again Next Year, Please","ferguson-6","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","27 January 2012","5/10"

You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything.

"Madame Web (2024)","Yikes","eoinageary","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","14 February 2024","3/10"

I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film.

"Madame Web (2024)","I am filled with hatred, it can't get any worse.","olcare","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","21 February 2024","1/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","20 February 2024","3/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","So bad it's good, or so bad it's bad? You decide","Skruffbagg","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","15 February 2024","1/10"

I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","21 February 2024","1/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","20 February 2024","3/10"

But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film.

"Madame Web (2024)","Yikes","eoinageary","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","14 February 2024","3/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","Sony needs to stop making superhero content","tbunker-88294","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","16 February 2024","1/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","I am filled with hatred, it can't get any worse.","olcare","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling.

The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction.

"Madame Web (2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","20 February 2024","3/10"

"Madame Web (2024)","Makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight","MovieWarfare","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","15 February 2024","1/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","How are bad writers able to continually get hired for big budget films?","syntory","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","17 February 2024","2/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","I had a bad feeling about this one, going in...","AlsExGal","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","14 February 2024","2/10"
"Madame Web (2024)","A gigantic mess","chenp-54708","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","16 February 2024","1/10"

"Madame Web (2024)","Yikes","eoinageary","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition.

With just a bit over an hour of runtime, it's a compact yet entertaining package of joy that promises-and delivers-a much-needed escape into enjoyment.I also stand corrected on my take on JLo.

Let me be clear-it's not a case of ""it's so bad, it's good."" Far from it. This musical is a non-stop entertainment rollercoaster, perfectly blending the light-hearted with the more serious. JLo is hilariously lost, bringing a refreshing self-awareness without skimping on addressing the deeper currents running through her life.And if that wasn't enough to hook you, my man Neil deGrasse Tyson's cameo as a zodiac sign is nothing short of a scene-stealing, cosmic 11/10 experience. 😂😂😂In an era where skepticism often takes center stage, I urge you to leap off the bandwagon and give this thing a shot. With just a bit over an hour of runtime, it's a compact yet entertaining package of joy that promises-and delivers-a much-needed escape into enjoyment.I also stand corrected on my take on JLo. Beyond her sassy and talented persona lies a hopelessly lost romance ADDICT, a revelation that adds depth to her already character. Here's to her finding the happiness she deserves and continuing to evolve.Oh, and let's not forget-the cinematography? Absolutely stunning.","20 February 2024","8/10"

"Constellation (2024)","Here is the premise","jackbaumel","I wasn't entirely sure where the show was headed when early reviewers and synopsis described it as a show about an astronaut who returns to Earth to find it different. Through subtle and not so subtle scenes, the story builds its plot device on ""quantum physics for dummies"" to weave a story where two events can happen or not happen, and happen AND not happen at the same time. Understandably, this can be confusing to follow, and a good review and a bad one can coexist and both could be right.As with most interesting mysteries, there are secrets being kept that will be revealed. The show incorporates sci-fi horror elements, such as darkness, screams, imagery of the dead, and the terror of the unknown. The main premise seems that those who went out to space and back no longer experience reality as a certainty, in the quantum physical sense.The acting is fine though a bit uneven, but in retrospect, this could be due to the way the story develops nonlinearly at certain points. But the suspense does start to build up by the third episode, and there is enough there to make me speculate on what's going on. Some may need to suspend a little disbelief early on, on how the entire ISS can be rendered so useless by one impact, as if the minds of multiple space agencies haven't planned for myriad contingencies, module and system isolation and redundancy, etc. But it's realistic enough to get the story going.This appears to be a decent sci-fi horror suspense thriller in the making, and maintains Apple TV's standard for production quality.

The direction also appears solid. The supporting cast is also top notch. There's not a lot to complain about with this series, so I'll nitpick. Unfortunately, the plot's entire mystery relies on collapsing wave function (stuff happens because you looked at it) applied to human decision and experiences, which does not happen in physics (unless you believe the self help books where you ""vision it and it will happen to you""). Otherwise, I'm enjoying this well written, dialog strong drama.The cast are all very convincing in their roles. This series is filmed in Finland and avoids this ""cheap actor"" syndrome found in most Sci-Fi of today. This could be because most Sci-Fi these days are filmed in Canada using Canadian ""G'day eh?

It is eery and captivating. This isn't some big space adventure, though there are. Some amazing action sequences in the beginning.

"Constellation (2024)","Maybe you don't get it?","rlilgeberg","At the end of the first episode, I actually thought that I had watched the first two episodes until I checked and saw it was only the first. That first one hour episode seriously seemed like two hours of time.The story premise is really compelling and there are bits of story along the way of the first three episodes I watched that really reward you for sticking with it. But there's no doubt that either the person who directed the first episodes is trying to mess with the viewer's sense of timing or they just don't know how to direct or edit. Or someone doesn't.So, I kept getting this feeling, like why does this seem to constantly be dragging on and on? I'm normally very patient with a good story. Then in the second episode when Jo's capsule lands, I realized that I spent a full three and a half minutes watching her unbuckle her seat belt and begin to get out of the capsule. Three and a half minutes. That's an eternity for a scene that should have taken maybe a minute max. Before that scene when she's sending messages to her family that she loves them, I noticed it was almost like she was dragging out the lines and repeating feelings two, three, even four times, like it was bizarrely written, acted, directed, or all three. I could literally see Jo pausing briefly between words, seemingly for emotional effect, like she was directed to do that. There were scenes when Jo is reunited with her family where they were so awkwardly long that I found myself wondering if they were acting awkward toward Jo or if the scene was just so long that I was reading too much into what I saw in their acting. Like is Alice actually being awkward around Jo or is the actress playing Alice just standing there trying to act like she's supposed to be standing there staring coolly?The other strange part about this show is I had to turn on the English subtitles specifically with Closed Captioning. Because there were so many times I wasn't sure if I didn't hear the dialog or if it was just one of the languages I didn't understand and there were no subtitles. They flip flop between languages so often, like Swedish to English to Russian to English to Swedish to Russian, etc. That it often just doesn't make sense, like people don't do this in real life, so what's the point? I got later on that maybe there is a point of something subtle changing related to languages, but it was a whole lot of language immersion for just that one point to be made. There were many times when someone is speaking a language that had no English subtitles, just ""speaking Russian"" or ""Speaking Swedish"", like huh? Why? It seemed mostly pointless. Or maybe the point was the character in the scene does not understand, so you feel that by the lack of subtitles or English.And yet, this is a good show that I will keep watching. By the end I'll know for sure whether it was just poor writing and direction or if there was an actual point in the story as a whole. I'm hoping there's a point for all of this weirdness.","22 February 2024","7/10"

The action sequences on the space station were good, but the characters are bland and I don't care about them.And this all pales vs For All Mankind, which focuses on the space technology and how it might realistically evolve. This looks more like supernatural-horror-light sci fi in a space setting. Yall have fun with this, I'm out.","11 March 2024","9/10"

"Constellation (2024)","Maybe you don't get it?","rlilgeberg","At the end of the first episode, I actually thought that I had watched the first two episodes until I checked and saw it was only the first. That first one hour episode seriously seemed like two hours of time.The story premise is really compelling and there are bits of story along the way of the first three episodes I watched that really reward you for sticking with it. But there's no doubt that either the person who directed the first episodes is trying to mess with the viewer's sense of timing or they just don't know how to direct or edit. Or someone doesn't.So, I kept getting this feeling, like why does this seem to constantly be dragging on and on? I'm normally very patient with a good story. Then in the second episode when Jo's capsule lands, I realized that I spent a full three and a half minutes watching her unbuckle her seat belt and begin to get out of the capsule. Three and a half minutes. That's an eternity for a scene that should have taken maybe a minute max. Before that scene when she's sending messages to her family that she loves them, I noticed it was almost like she was dragging out the lines and repeating feelings two, three, even four times, like it was bizarrely written, acted, directed, or all three. I could literally see Jo pausing briefly between words, seemingly for emotional effect, like she was directed to do that. There were scenes when Jo is reunited with her family where they were so awkwardly long that I found myself wondering if they were acting awkward toward Jo or if the scene was just so long that I was reading too much into what I saw in their acting. Like is Alice actually being awkward around Jo or is the actress playing Alice just standing there trying to act like she's supposed to be standing there staring coolly?The other strange part about this show is I had to turn on the English subtitles specifically with Closed Captioning. Because there were so many times I wasn't sure if I didn't hear the dialog or if it was just one of the languages I didn't understand and there were no subtitles. They flip flop between languages so often, like Swedish to English to Russian to English to Swedish to Russian, etc. That it often just doesn't make sense, like people don't do this in real life, so what's the point? I got later on that maybe there is a point of something subtle changing related to languages, but it was a whole lot of language immersion for just that one point to be made. There were many times when someone is speaking a language that had no English subtitles, just ""speaking Russian"" or ""Speaking Swedish"", like huh? Why? It seemed mostly pointless. Or maybe the point was the character in the scene does not understand, so you feel that by the lack of subtitles or English.And yet, this is a good show that I will keep watching. By the end I'll know for sure whether it was just poor writing and direction or if there was an actual point in the story as a whole. I'm hoping there's a point for all of this weirdness.","22 February 2024","7/10"

The action sequences on the space station were good, but the characters are bland and I don't care about them.And this all pales vs For All Mankind, which focuses on the space technology and how it might realistically evolve.

Understandably, this can be confusing to follow, and a good review and a bad one can coexist and both could be right.As with most interesting mysteries, there are secrets being kept that will be revealed. The show incorporates sci-fi horror elements, such as darkness, screams, imagery of the dead, and the terror of the unknown. The main premise seems that those who went out to space and back no longer experience reality as a certainty, in the quantum physical sense.The acting is fine though a bit uneven, but in retrospect, this could be due to the way the story develops nonlinearly at certain points. But the suspense does start to build up by the third episode, and there is enough there to make me speculate on what's going on. Some may need to suspend a little disbelief early on, on how the entire ISS can be rendered so useless by one impact, as if the minds of multiple space agencies haven't planned for myriad contingencies, module and system isolation and redundancy, etc. But it's realistic enough to get the story going.This appears to be a decent sci-fi horror suspense thriller in the making, and maintains Apple TV's standard for production quality.

You are drawn right into the dilemma faced by the international space crew as they fight for survival after an unexplained freak accident.By the third episode you come to earth for some air, but your mind is still running the gauntlet in this ambiguous Sci-Fi mystery that sucks you into a vortex with its clever structure and bravery in not giving away too much information, but just enough to become a junkie to it.Let's hope that it maintains its course without over-explaining and sustains the ambiguity right to the final frame of the series.","22 February 2024","5/10"
"Constellation (2024)","Nope. Another Sci-fi ruined by filler relationships","amoore-4","A show that truly screws with the mind and delves into the horrors of the edges of reality and the unknowns presented by the quantum realm which is not well understood and described by science.One of the few shows that actually scares me, but in a good way, it's enthralling and pulls me into the terrors experienced by the characters experiencing their world in utter inexplicable disarray. I found it oddly relatable in a way, with many parallels to my life and how choices impact my path.Sure a lot of it takes leaps from scientific ideas that may not be quite fully baked out, but it is sci-fi after all. It reminds me of one of my old favorite shows, Fringe. At first I wasn't convinced that the show was worth watching but each episode has pulled me in more and really satisfied my thirst for good mind opening sci-fi. I think it deserves a much higher score than what it has here.","21 February 2024","8/10"
"Constellation (2024)","It's in my weekly fix...","DukeEman","Very entertaining, with a base in science and space history.Noomi Rapace and Jonathan Banks are mesmerizing and allowed to give solid performances. The direction also appears solid. The supporting cast is also top notch. There's not a lot to complain about with this series, so I'll nitpick. Unfortunately, the plot's entire mystery relies on collapsing wave function (stuff happens because you looked at it) applied to human decision and experiences, which does not happen in physics (unless you believe the self help books where you ""vision it and it will happen to you""). Otherwise, I'm enjoying this well written, dialog strong drama.The cast are all very convincing in their roles. This series is filmed in Finland and avoids this ""cheap actor"" syndrome found in most Sci-Fi of today. This could be because most Sci-Fi these days are filmed in Canada using Canadian ""G'day eh? I'm a tough cop from Brooklin, you hoser"" actors.Well done.","15 March 2024","10/10"
"Constellation (2024)","Underrated","dan428","I'm seeing a lot of low reviews that read as if people are not picking up on the hints that are being given to us so far. They talk about the family drama being fillers and that the story isn't focused enough on space. I feel that the reasons for this will become apparent as the plot progresses and that all these scenes are foreshadowing.This show is the first show in quite a while that has completely drawn me in. It is eery and captivating. This isn't some big space adventure, though there are. Some amazing action sequences in the beginning. I just think that a lot of people don't get what I am assuming this show is going to be actually about even though some of it is spelled out towards the end of the 3rd episode.","22 February 2024","8/10"
"Constellation (2024)","Noomi Rapace and Jonathan Banks perfectly cast in this psychological mystery set in space","dean-202","70% Psychological Thriller

Pay attention, and this is sure to deliver. This is not a Star Trek type of like. If you are into the riduculousness of non-science space travel, I can't recommend it, and you'll most likely become bored fairly easily. Noomi Rapace delivers a fantastic performance. Pay close attention to each detail, every word actually matters. I actually rewatched the first five episodes, and found several clues of what I missed the first go around when things started becoming clearer as to the premise by the end of the 5th episode.Cheers!","21 February 2024","3/10"
"Constellation (2024)","Great start, then starts to fade a bit","Xavier_Stone","Noomi Rapace is one of my favorite actors and she does not disappoint in Constellation, in fact she more of less carries this series. Rosie Coleman is really good as well and I can only imagine how difficult it must be to play her part.In any case, I believe the negative reviews are by people who do not understand quantum physics and as such, do not ""get"" what is actually going on.It is as @yooniverse has written, a story where two events take place and do not take place at the very same time, which is why things can get a bit confusing, but trough out the entire series, a subtle hint is constantly given, a ""pointer"" so to speak, but you need to understand quantum physics to really appreciate the show.","24 February 2024","10/10"
"Constellation (2024)","Maybe you don't get it?","rlilgeberg","At the end of the first episode, I actually thought that I had watched the first two episodes until I checked and saw it was only the first. That first one hour episode seriously seemed like two hours of time.The story premise is really compelling and there are bits of story along the way of the first three episodes I watched that really reward you for sticking with it. But there's no doubt that either the person who directed the first episodes is trying to mess with the viewer's sense of timing or they just don't know how to direct or edit. Or someone doesn't.So, I kept getting this feeling, like why does this seem to constantly be dragging on and on? I'm normally very patient with a good story. Then in the second episode when Jo's capsule lands, I realized that I spent a full three and a half minutes watching her unbuckle her seat belt and begin to get out of the capsule. Three and a half minutes. That's an eternity for a scene that should have taken maybe a minute max. Before that scene when she's sending messages to her family that she loves them, I noticed it was almost like she was dragging out the lines and repeating feelings two, three, even four times, like it was bizarrely written, acted, directed, or all three. I could literally see Jo pausing briefly between words, seemingly for emotional effect, like she was directed to do that. There were scenes when Jo is reunited with her family where they were so awkwardly long that I found myself wondering if they were acting awkward toward Jo or if the scene was just so long that I was reading too much into what I saw in their acting. Like is Alice actually being awkward around Jo or is the actress playing Alice just standing there trying to act like she's supposed to be standing there staring coolly?The other strange part about this show is I had to turn on the English subtitles specifically with Closed Captioning. Because there were so many times I wasn't sure if I didn't hear the dialog or if it was just one of the languages I didn't understand and there were no subtitles. They flip flop between languages so often, like Swedish to English to Russian to English to Swedish to Russian, etc. That it often just doesn't make sense, like people don't do this in real life, so what's the point? I got later on that maybe there is a point of something subtle changing related to languages, but it was a whole lot of language immersion for just that one point to be made. There were many times when someone is speaking a language that had no English subtitles, just ""speaking Russian"" or ""Speaking Swedish"", like huh? Why? It seemed mostly pointless. Or maybe the point was the character in the scene does not understand, so you feel that by the lack of subtitles or English.And yet, this is a good show that I will keep watching. By the end I'll know for sure whether it was just poor writing and direction or if there was an actual point in the story as a whole. I'm hoping there's a point for all of this weirdness.","22 February 2024","7/10"
"Constellation (2024)","You Think You Know, But ...","coleco2000","I usually enjoy epic space based sci fi and Apple is certainly good at it but compared with For All Mankind, this just isn't cutting it.The earth-based intro sequence with a lot of mood and mystery made me think, this isn't going to be sci fi at all, it's going to be supernatural horror. The action sequences on the space station were good, but the characters are bland and I don't care about them.And this all pales vs For All Mankind, which focuses on the space technology and how it might realistically evolve. This looks more like supernatural-horror-light sci fi in a space setting. Yall have fun with this, I'm out.","11 March 2024","9/10"
"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training (2024)","Yes and No","dorMancyx","The Mugen Train used to be one of my most anticipated movies of 2020, and the Demon Slayer manga has been a great part of my quarantine life. However, I have to say that this film is quite perfunctorily made. Most of the dialogues spend 15 minutes conveying emotions and information that could've been condensed into 3 minutes. Such pacing certainly works for a season-long anime so that you get the most out of each character, but is excessive to the point of tedious for an adapted screenplay. Additionally, the movie focuses on the transition period from season 3 to the Hashira Training Arc, which seems like unnecessary work since it's not an independent story like the Mugen Train. Instead of spending so much time explaining the context, why not make a film about the actual Hashira Training? Aside from the complaints, all the action sequences are spot-on as expected. The segment where the Wind and Serpent Hashira explored the mansion is perfect in length and smoothly animated, and seeing their breathing styles in motion is all I could ask for as a manga reader. Though I'm all for the Infinity Castle Arc to come as soon as possible, I'd ask that Ufotable take as much time as needed to perfect the animation. As a former global phenomenon, Demon Slayer deserves a proper end.","23 February 2024","6/10"

However, I have to say that this film is quite perfunctorily made. Most of the dialogues spend 15 minutes conveying emotions and information that could've been condensed into 3 minutes. Such pacing certainly works for a season-long anime so that you get the most out of each character, but is excessive to the point of tedious for an adapted screenplay. Additionally, the movie focuses on the transition period from season 3 to the Hashira Training Arc, which seems like unnecessary work since it's not an independent story like the Mugen Train. Instead of spending so much time explaining the context, why not make a film about the actual Hashira Training? Aside from the complaints, all the action sequences are spot-on as expected. The segment where the Wind and Serpent Hashira explored the mansion is perfect in length and smoothly animated, and seeing their breathing styles in motion is all I could ask for as a manga reader. Though I'm all for the Infinity Castle Arc to come as soon as possible, I'd ask that Ufotable take as much time as needed to perfect the animation.

And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","27 February 2024","5/10"

Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","22 February 2024","6/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Gorgeous effects, failure of characters","ramosaral","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","27 February 2024","3/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","No, it's not that good and don't even compare it to the Netflix One Piece","MissSimonetta","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","22 February 2024","6/10"

The animated series has a 9.4 rating here and the movie only a 4.0 so people have been hungry for a good live adaptation of the animated series for a long time. It's finally here. It's almost impossible to please everyone who liked the original animated series because everyone has their own expectations on how it should be and they hate when it differs even a little from the original. They don't seem to understand how they don't have the luxury of having unlimited episodes and get go as in depth as the original, it has to be adapted into only 8 episodes per season.

"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Too rushed and soulless","msmy98","Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I've never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I've read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it.

The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","22 February 2024","6/10"

"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Too rushed and soulless","msmy98","Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I've never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I've read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it.

"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","I can see why the original writers left","tevernaugh-76446","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","27 February 2024","5/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","I turned it off and watched the original cartoon instead.","poseyfan","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","22 February 2024","6/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Gorgeous effects, failure of characters","ramosaral","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","27 February 2024","3/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","No, it's not that good and don't even compare it to the Netflix One Piece","MissSimonetta","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","22 February 2024","6/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Lost Arc of Aang","pollereulogy","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","22 February 2024","6/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Now we know why DiMartino and K split...","Shiryu05","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","24 February 2024","5/10"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024)","Weak dialogue and rushed pacing compromise an otherwise well-done adaptation","seige-hound","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it.

Some of the dialog almost takes the place of the action at times, as is should in any great action movie. So many great Horror/paranormal TV series suffer from trying to be sensitive and politically correct, while also appealing to as many people as possible. Bad formula! The entire series of 'Le Brea' is the archetypal example of a completely failed script writing that was unworthy of both actors and all behind-the-scenes talent. When I see a series like Reacher, as well as many others, I am reminded that it's all about the money, and the shortsightedness of people with no creative vision whatsoever.

"The Tourist (2022–2024)","A solid thriller with a surprising number of laughs","Tweekums","""The Tourist"" has a very ""Fargo"" feel to it, set in the vast open fields of Australia which makes it the more fascinating. Starting out with action and a mystery, this short series has enough eclectic elements to keep you captivated. First, there is a mysterious guy, followed by a very sympathetic ""cop,"" delightfully played by Danielle Macdonald. This actress is the biggest revelation here. Danielle portrays the character with so much heart that every scene with her character Helen just shines. More quirky characters are introduced, notably the American cowboy played by an Icelandic actor, the detective, and the cop trainee. The plot does get convoluted but loose ends are still tightened up so you don't lose your grip. The cinematography, camera work, and editing do justice to the sweeping Australian Outback beauty. Best of all, there is some snide dark humor that's quite enjoyable from characters that you least expect to be funny in real life.","8 March 2022","9/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Fargo-esque with two very likable leads","julieshotmail","I've noticed that The Tourist has been on Netflix's Top 10 since it came out earlier this year. The first season originally came out in the U. K. in 2022 where it was the most watched show of the year there too. I finally got around to watching it and have to say I really enjoyed it. It does start a little slow in the first episode so you might feel like giving up but don't, stick with it because it's worth it. It really picks up about midway through the second episode. All the actors give really good performances, especially Jamie Dornan. They really pull you into their world to the point where you really start to care about their characters and what happens to them. I really couldn't wait to find out more and more about Dornan's identity.","25 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Starts a little slow but picks up in a hurry","Supermanfan-13","The Tourist is one of those rare shows that provides exactly what you want it to: it's a taught thriller with some old tropes -- amnesia, vicious drug lords, femme fatales, the woman with the heart of gold who wants to save the hero -- that are presented in way that manage to make them feel fresh and original due to the excellent direction and script.Most of all, however, the show's success is due to the two leads. Danielle MacDonald plays one of the unlikeliest heroines in a long time; she plays the ungainly, unglamorous part perfectly. But it's Jamie Dornan, the pretty boy, ex-model, former Shades of Gray guy who turns in a wildly riveting performance as the show's anti-hero. His acting is so perfectly on the mark it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.","15 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Promises suspense, delivers suspense.","Laight","I found that The Tourist is even more entertaining than people were saying it was. The Tourists follows an unnamed man (Jaime Dornan) who loses his memory after a car accident. We literally know nothing about him or the story. He wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he was or what he did. All he has is a note to go to a diner at a specific time but as soon as he leaves the hospital there are people trying to kill him. From there he needs to find out who he is and what he did for people to want to kill him before it's too late. Jaime Dornan looks like he's on the verge of becoming a pretty big star. There are only two seasons at only six episodes apiece so it's an easy binge.","25 February 2024","10/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Entertaining","DiCaprioFan1","'The Tourist' begins when a man wakes up after a car crash in the Australian outback unable to remember who he is, and a viewer might think they're about to watch a familiar kind of drama series. Instead, what follows is uncommonly inventive, in terms of both plot and presentation, frequently blackly comic but just as frequently, plain black. The protagonists vary between those who are purely evil, those who seem decent but with unforgiveable histories, and a few nice guys who mostly don't last very long. By design, it's tonally uneven, though persistantly creative and clever.","31 January 2022","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Ambitious, clever and uneven","paul2001sw-1","A man (Jamie Dornan) is run off the road by a tanker truck in the Australian outback. He wakes up in the hospital with full blown amnesia. He doesn't even know his name. New cop Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald) doggedly investigates.Jamie Dornan may be the big name of this series, but it's Danielle Macdonald that I find more compelling. She has a great sweetness to her acting. She's basically the cop in Fargo except not pregnant. This show does try to do some comedy mostly through characters like Ethan. It is not my favorite aspect of the show. This lasted two seasons with specific stories for each.","23 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Edgy indie feel but too much leeway","OneAnjel","This looked good and once Ólafur Darri Ólafsson entered the scene, I remembered that I'd seen this before. Add in Danielle Macdonald (the trainee constable) and Damon Herriman, you know it's going to be one hell of a good show!The scenery is, at times spectacular. And others, down and gritty.

The first season originally came out in the U. K. in 2022 where it was the most watched show of the year there too. I finally got around to watching it and have to say I really enjoyed it. It does start a little slow in the first episode so you might feel like giving up but don't, stick with it because it's worth it. It really picks up about midway through the second episode. All the actors give really good performances, especially Jamie Dornan. They really pull you into their world to the point where you really start to care about their characters and what happens to them. I really couldn't wait to find out more and more about Dornan's identity.","25 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Starts a little slow but picks up in a hurry","Supermanfan-13","The Tourist is one of those rare shows that provides exactly what you want it to: it's a taught thriller with some old tropes -- amnesia, vicious drug lords, femme fatales, the woman with the heart of gold who wants to save the hero -- that are presented in way that manage to make them feel fresh and original due to the excellent direction and script.Most of all, however, the show's success is due to the two leads. Danielle MacDonald plays one of the unlikeliest heroines in a long time; she plays the ungainly, unglamorous part perfectly. But it's Jamie Dornan, the pretty boy, ex-model, former Shades of Gray guy who turns in a wildly riveting performance as the show's anti-hero. His acting is so perfectly on the mark it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.","15 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Promises suspense, delivers suspense.","Laight","I found that The Tourist is even more entertaining than people were saying it was. The Tourists follows an unnamed man (Jaime Dornan) who loses his memory after a car accident. We literally know nothing about him or the story. He wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he was or what he did. All he has is a note to go to a diner at a specific time but as soon as he leaves the hospital there are people trying to kill him. From there he needs to find out who he is and what he did for people to want to kill him before it's too late. Jaime Dornan looks like he's on the verge of becoming a pretty big star. There are only two seasons at only six episodes apiece so it's an easy binge.","25 February 2024","10/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Entertaining","DiCaprioFan1","'The Tourist' begins when a man wakes up after a car crash in the Australian outback unable to remember who he is, and a viewer might think they're about to watch a familiar kind of drama series. Instead, what follows is uncommonly inventive, in terms of both plot and presentation, frequently blackly comic but just as frequently, plain black. The protagonists vary between those who are purely evil, those who seem decent but with unforgiveable histories, and a few nice guys who mostly don't last very long. By design, it's tonally uneven, though persistantly creative and clever.","31 January 2022","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Ambitious, clever and uneven","paul2001sw-1","A man (Jamie Dornan) is run off the road by a tanker truck in the Australian outback. He wakes up in the hospital with full blown amnesia. He doesn't even know his name. New cop Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald) doggedly investigates.Jamie Dornan may be the big name of this series, but it's Danielle Macdonald that I find more compelling. She has a great sweetness to her acting. She's basically the cop in Fargo except not pregnant. This show does try to do some comedy mostly through characters like Ethan. It is not my favorite aspect of the show. This lasted two seasons with specific stories for each.","23 February 2024","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Edgy indie feel but too much leeway","OneAnjel","This looked good and once Ólafur Darri Ólafsson entered the scene, I remembered that I'd seen this before. Add in Danielle Macdonald (the trainee constable) and Damon Herriman, you know it's going to be one hell of a good show!The scenery is, at times spectacular. And others, down and gritty. Kinda like the story itself.The story is filled with twists and turns as you learn a bit more about who - and what - the tourist really is, so don't take a break without putting it on pause.I'm glad Netflix put this on ""rerun"". I've actually run out of things to view and this is refreshing and actually smart. What a change from the usual stuff that's out there now.Give it a whirl - and you'll be up at 4 AM too if you binge it too late in the day.","12 January 2022","6/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","endearing Danielle Macdonald","SnoopyStyle","I do not want want to go into serious details about this, mostly because it just hitting the 8 out of 10 mark for me with basically everything. Story, script, acting, dialogues, camerawork, score, all making it way above average. However, the female lead, the policewoman Danielle Macdonald, is a revelation. She manages to be extremely cute and horribly annoying at the same time. In that case, I reckon, I also have to give credit to the director. The conclusion of the story is profoundly shocking. What a ride!","11 February 2024","7/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","Bing until 5 AM if you're not careful","thejdrage","I was drawn to this show when I noticed Damon Herriman (Justified, Mr Inbetween) was in it - for me he's usually a signpost that something good is going on.I got through the first episode, which was billed more as a road-trip car duel / horror genre, before realising that this was actually going to be a proper thriller - and one that becomes increasingly binge-worthy as it goes.It does, at times, capture some of the claustrophobia and horror of Wolf Creek, but for me it has more in common with the gradually building menace of Wake in Fright - (in this case) an Irishman out of his depth and out of his mind in outback Australia - never loosing that feeling that everyone else is two steps ahead of him.And I was right about Herriman, he doesn't disappoint, but to single him out would also be to do something of a disservice to a number of great performances and a strong supporting cast - whom, it must be said, seemed quite at home in their lives of quiet desperation ... outback style.Satisfying binge material.","2 January 2022","8/10"
"The Tourist (2022–2024)","It's a slow burner, but man, wow! Powerful as hell","godsnames","I was absolutely loving this mini series. The first five episodes were brilliant and this was easily headed for a 10. The final episode was a bit choppy though and knocked it down from perfection but it did manage to finish strong.To start, Jamie Dornan is such a powerful screen presence and gave such a strong performance. It was a pleasure watching him throughout. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, amazing! He stole every scene. I just looked at his past credits and will certainly be watching some of his previous work. Woooo, I just saw that he was Bing Partridge in NOS4A2. I didn't remember him from that. He was a standout there and certainly here as well.Another standout was Damon Herriman. I did remember him from his past work. Dewey Crowe in Justified and Charles Manson in Mindhunter were just a few of past roles where he crushed it, especially Dewey. I wish they would bring Justified back.Other supporting cast did their jobs as well but a special mention to the actors who played the various locals, pretty much all of them. In particular, the helicopter rentals guys and Rhonda Doyle (Constable Carter), hilarious. These were all captivating performances that kept a smile on my face and really pushed this rating up so high.This is a very special TV mini series that is not only worth the watch but should be saved and then savored for when you want to be thoroughly entertained.","3 January 2022","8/10"

"Saltburn (2023)","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10"
"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"
"Saltburn (2023)","Didn't work for me","ThatDoesntMatter","Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.","9 December 2023","3/10"
"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"
"Saltburn (2023)","An artful disappointment","steveinadelaide","Other reviewers use the word ""derivative"" a lot to describe this film. They're not wrong! And my God this is a tedious film to try to get through! The so-called twist at the end is anything but.

I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E.

"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"

"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"

"Saltburn (2023)","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10"

"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10"

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible.

As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal.

One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10"

Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10"

I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.","2 January 2024","4/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10"
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.","18 October 2023","5/10"

It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.","31 July 2023","6/10"

"KBarbie (I) (2023)","3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.","imseeg","I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?","24 July 2023","7/10"

"KBarbie (I) (2023)","Beautiful film, but so preachy","LoveofLegacy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives.

The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men.

While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.","21 July 2023","6/10"

"KBarbie (I) (2023)","3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.","imseeg","I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?","24 July 2023","7/10"

You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst.

I feel like it was a better show in Barbieland where it seemed more realistic.There isn't anything wrong with the acting or production, but the script is weak, particularly when they get to the real world.

They'll be going into the real world, soon.""Well, it didn't get better, after they went into the real world. I feel like it was a better show in Barbieland where it seemed more realistic.There isn't anything wrong with the acting or production, but the script is weak, particularly when they get to the real world. People just don't act like that. I'm disappointed for the actors, I think they thought it would be a great movie, however it's much more of a letdown.","20 July 2023","6/10"

That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon.

"KBarbie (I) (2023)","Beautiful film, but so preachy","LoveofLegacy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.","26 July 2023","6/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","A Hot Pink Mess","aherdofbeautifulwildponies","The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.","23 July 2023","6/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.","Revuer223","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.","31 July 2023","6/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.","ramair350","It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.","22 July 2023","10/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","Too heavy handed","Natcat87","8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.","21 July 2023","6/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","Well this really did come as a surprise.","Sleepin_Dragon","I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.","22 July 2023","8/10"
"KBarbie (I) (2023)","3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.","imseeg","I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?","24 July 2023","7/10"

The plot, such as it is, goes nowhere and at two episodes in I was utterly bored. None of the characters are remotely likeable and the acting is pedestrian at best; Kidman gives another of her now oh so familiar dead eyed facially paralysed performances that make you yearn for the actress that promised and delivered so much. Watching this reminded me of that wave of 70's avant garde theatre productions where all of the first act was spent staring out of a window or waiting for a letter to arrive.

The storyline is brilliant and it has me completely absorbed in it and glued to my seat wanting more.

"Expats (2023–2024)","If you're an adult, ignore the negative reviews from teens","lovelyxnight","Expats is an interesting mix of The Leftovers (for its meditations on grief/loss) and Big Little Lies (for its ""rich miserable people"" themes). While the series does from time to time fulfill those lofty ambitions, it doesn't do so frequently enough to truly be considered great.For a very basic overview, Expats follow the exploits of three women living in Hong Kong but originally from the United States (hence the title). Margaret (Nicole Kidman) is undergoing a severe family tragedy regarding a missing child. Hilary (Sarayu Blue) seemingly has it all--career, style, beauty--but struggles with any sort of home/family life outside of her job, especially as it pertains to David (Jack Huston). Mercy (Ji-young Yoo) is a young woman torn between her teenaged Hong Kong adventures and more serious dalliances with older men and the local protest scene (of which she wants to be a part of). As the series progresses through its six episodes, these three characters converge in often-unexpected ways.There are times when Expats hits the very heights of prestige TV drama. Certain scenes and character interactions will have you absolutely rapt and thinking deeply about your own life through the compelling arcs. I was especially drawn to the Hilary character, but each angle has its heights to be sure. Series creator Lulu Wang also takes risks--like a feature-length (1:40.00) episode almost exclusively devoted to Hong Kong's domestic help industry. It certainly isn't a show afraid of ""big swings"".Now, do those prodigious hacks always produce solid contact? Not necessarily. The first episode can be a little overwhelming until the groundwork is laid, and it crams a lot of serious topics into its scant six-episode run. All the character resolutions may not be everyone's cup of tea, either. Somewhat oddly, this is a series that--at least for me--was a little less than the sum of its parts. In other words, my individual episode rankings slightly outpaced what I ultimately thought of the season as a whole.That is truly the best way I can describe my experience watching Expats. Each episode had enough highly emotional or deeply thought-provoking moments to never be boring or outright poor, but in the grand scheme of things I didn't feel like it added up to much. A solid watch for those who enjoy deeper fare--but perhaps not one that will rocket to the top of best-of lists.","29 February 2024","8/10"

It's heartbreaking to see everyone leaving Hong Kong now due to all the chaos. Such a fantastic city, and let's hope this show won't end up being the last historical record of its finest moments. The camera work is a letdown, though. It feels too confined and doesn't capture the true essence of modern Hong Kong's awesomeness. This episode clearly is just sets the scene for the story.

It's just peolpe talking and drinking with no rhyme of reason to the dialog. I guess the main theme is Kidman losing her most irritating child Gus, but from what we see of Gus he will not be missed.

Even the flat characters are not ... that flat, they are just in a different reality.The intertwined destiny of EACH character is interesting and I cannot wait for more. Also, I'm so glad that it's running weekly, like before - when you had to wait for the show. But at the same time you had some time to think about it before it comes, talk with your friends, stop and think, not just bluntly continue to the next episode to wait for something to... happen. Something should happen inside of you.I'm especially positively surprised with the last one (S1E05) - being an expat living in Dubai for such a long time, and working and observing Filipino workers closely, I could feel the Filipino story being told so ... gently... truthfully... and honestly... From the gossip moment to the moment when they are treated just like people from the background yet... They always, always have each other's back.A lot of time, people forget that each human and each person has their own story to be told, and all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

Does she love her children? Hate them? Is she happy or sad? I honestly can't tell because every facial expression is the same frozen, over-plumped, injected tragedy.

From the gossip moment to the moment when they are treated just like people from the background yet... They always, always have each other's back.A lot of time, people forget that each human and each person has their own story to be told, and all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

None of the characters are remotely likeable and the acting is pedestrian at best; Kidman gives another of her now oh so familiar dead eyed facially paralysed performances that make you yearn for the actress that promised and delivered so much. Watching this reminded me of that wave of 70's avant garde theatre productions where all of the first act was spent staring out of a window or waiting for a letter to arrive.

"Expats (2023–2024)","If you're an adult, ignore the negative reviews from teens","lovelyxnight","Expats is an interesting mix of The Leftovers (for its meditations on grief/loss) and Big Little Lies (for its ""rich miserable people"" themes). While the series does from time to time fulfill those lofty ambitions, it doesn't do so frequently enough to truly be considered great.For a very basic overview, Expats follow the exploits of three women living in Hong Kong but originally from the United States (hence the title). Margaret (Nicole Kidman) is undergoing a severe family tragedy regarding a missing child. Hilary (Sarayu Blue) seemingly has it all--career, style, beauty--but struggles with any sort of home/family life outside of her job, especially as it pertains to David (Jack Huston). Mercy (Ji-young Yoo) is a young woman torn between her teenaged Hong Kong adventures and more serious dalliances with older men and the local protest scene (of which she wants to be a part of). As the series progresses through its six episodes, these three characters converge in often-unexpected ways.There are times when Expats hits the very heights of prestige TV drama. Certain scenes and character interactions will have you absolutely rapt and thinking deeply about your own life through the compelling arcs. I was especially drawn to the Hilary character, but each angle has its heights to be sure. Series creator Lulu Wang also takes risks--like a feature-length (1:40.00) episode almost exclusively devoted to Hong Kong's domestic help industry. It certainly isn't a show afraid of ""big swings"".Now, do those prodigious hacks always produce solid contact? Not necessarily. The first episode can be a little overwhelming until the groundwork is laid, and it crams a lot of serious topics into its scant six-episode run. All the character resolutions may not be everyone's cup of tea, either. Somewhat oddly, this is a series that--at least for me--was a little less than the sum of its parts. In other words, my individual episode rankings slightly outpaced what I ultimately thought of the season as a whole.That is truly the best way I can describe my experience watching Expats. Each episode had enough highly emotional or deeply thought-provoking moments to never be boring or outright poor, but in the grand scheme of things I didn't feel like it added up to much. A solid watch for those who enjoy deeper fare--but perhaps not one that will rocket to the top of best-of lists.","29 February 2024","8/10"

It's heartbreaking to see everyone leaving Hong Kong now due to all the chaos. Such a fantastic city, and let's hope this show won't end up being the last historical record of its finest moments. The camera work is a letdown, though. It feels too confined and doesn't capture the true essence of modern Hong Kong's awesomeness. This episode clearly is just sets the scene for the story.

They always, always have each other's back.A lot of time, people forget that each human and each person has their own story to be told, and all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

Ep 2 is where the story begins to take root. I sense that it was a stylistic choice to have the pilot as it was. Nonetheless, I love it and it's really a well made series. One of the best shots that I've ever seen in a series. I do recommend the series. I wish it was available for bingeing - however l, without it... it's a slow burn! And I'm here for it.

Long pauses and gestures and strange facial expressions and NO ONE KNOWS WHY! She must think her very presence carries the film. It does not! For a first episode, it is so dull. I'm not going to watch the second.The extra characters in the film are boring and one dimensional characters. The children running around are more interesting. Oh well. I've wasted my time before.

I was so distracted every time Kidman's face came on screen. Her lips make speaking look difficult and painful and her cheeks are....weird. HOLLYWOOD: AGING IS OK. It honestly ruins the whole show. Does she love her children? Hate them? Is she happy or sad? I honestly can't tell because every facial expression is the same frozen, over-plumped, injected tragedy. Human emotions move human emotions, and authentic facial expressions are key. Nicole: it's ok. Play your age and stop the madness that pressures other women to follow.","31 January 2024","8/10"

When the process is right, that's good but it's no guarantee of anything beyond the generic. That's where chemistry comes in. The cast of Young Sheldon has chemistry. 
Much of the negative criticism in this forum is unwarranted I think. Viewers have been conditioned to mindless action, filth and gore to the extent where they can't see subtlety or appreciate an aside anymore. Look at how Two and a Half Men degenerated season after season from suggestivity (an art form) to near depravity. This happens due to a never ending demand to push the barriers of whatever the premise originally mandated to ensure ever increasing laughs or scares or rushes of adrenaline. Same thing happened to American Horror Story. 
It remains to be seen what the future holds for Young Sheldon but by virtue of the nature of a prequel, it's future is probably our present. This is where the writing, directing and interpretation of the characters needs to tread carefully. 
Too many reviews in this forum were done after just episode 1. 
It's a great show with some old fashioned values. The chemistry between Sheldon and Missy is magic. Reagan (Missy) nearly steals the show. Zoe Perry deserves an Emmy. She nails the Mary role. As does Annie Potts with Meemaw. 
Let's face it, the ""fish out of water""premise has sustained comedy since there was comedy. The Three Stooges and the Marx brothers in high society. Check out Hoi Polloi and Night at the Opera as examples that typify the notion. Without ill fitting tuxes though, the Stooges would've worn thin. Without Margaret Dumont, the Marxes would've become tired quickly. Penny is the Big Bang's Dumont. Now in Young Sheldon, he himself is the Dumont amongst a horde of red necks, dummies and well intended warm working class folk. That's why it works for me. I sincerely hope the producers respect the short shelf life that this series has and resists any temptation to move away from the excellent formula the first season has created. It's a series that I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to do. Young Georgie is just as appealing as Sheldon. He's a brat but warm hearted enough not to dislike him. Missy is feisty without being precocious. Meemaw is earthy without being a lush. George likes his booze and BBQ's without being a loser. And Mary is the glue. Forget the millenials who's short attention spans have cheapened their taste. It's a great show. I can't get enough.","2 February 2018","10/10"
"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","Enjoyable","munchere-260-598799","I have a problem with the reviewers complaining about how Sheldon is such a brat and at the same time say they watch TBBT. If they watch that show then they must know Sheldon is a brat. In this show, though, we have a 9 year old version of a bratty Sheldon. In both cases he isn't bratty because he's spoiled or mean hearted. He's bratty because he's a genius and a social simpleton. That's the point. 
I Iiked the show right off but I can also say that it has improved as these brief, less than 30 minute, episodes are able to develop the characters and relationships more. One reviewer complained about the lack of character development after only watching the first show! 
I also think the actor playing young Sheldon is doing a great job. As with the adult Sheldon the young Sheldon is sincere, wants to be good, knows his own mind but also knows that he doesn't understand social norms and so listens to those close to him although he reserves the right to not accept those norms. I enjoy the family dynamic and the situations that arise because he's special. This family is much more realistic than the Malcom in the Middle family, a show one reviewer touted as being at a level this show couldn't come up to. The characters in MITM were ridiculously stupid. The characters in Young Sheldon each ha ve a unique personality and do things that you have seen others do or can imagine others doing, like Sheldon's brother trying chewing tobacco, repeatedly spitting it out in disgust then saying ""I must be doing something wrong"". 
The writing warms the heart as we watch a family moving past disagreements and difficulties caused by their special Sheldon - all realizing that they love him and he's family which is more important than those disagreements and difficulties.","27 September 2017","9/10"

And now that I've watched six episodes, I feel fully justified in saying this is terrific television.The show centers on the childhood of The Big Bang Theory's high- functioning autistic genius Sheldon Cooper. Sheldon is a quirky savant in a very ordinary family with a religious mom and a puzzled dad. Too smart for his peers, the 9-year-old Sheldon is boosted to high school, where he promptly alienates everyone.Some people complain that Sheldon is too annoying, but why would you want a series about a young Sheldon if you didn't want to see someone annoying? I find the kid version less irritating, primarily because he is powerless and thus is not, like his adult counterpart, bullying and browbeating and insulting his friends to get his way. Young Sheldon is just trying to survive and, more importantly, learn.In fact, my main concern is that Sheldon seems a little too normal. He's got some funny habits and is a bit obsessive, but I would have expected someone far *more* obnoxious and weird. He really just seems precocious and socially clueless.I wasn't surprised that Sheldon is socially inept or sometimes rude - if you are, then once again I have to ask why on earth you watched this show. I was surprised at the sweetness of the series.

While TBBT is more or less a nerdy version of Friends, Young Sheldon is more like a classic family comedy with typical family problems and the special task of raising an Asperger genius.
The key ingredients are the same as in TBBT though - fresh humor, well defined characters and a brilliant cast.

Let me just start off by saying that I never got into big bang theory. I had friends who were really into it, but whenever I watched it I just saw it as cringe nerd humor by people who weren't actually nerds... Or that's what I thought at the time. As time has gone on, I realize that there's a lot more inside jokes, and deeper moments in that show... and the reason why I've come around to it is 100% because of a Young Sheldon. It takes the best parts of Big Bang Theory and gets rid of the cringey laugh track style comedy for a more dry and intelligent sense of humor and extremely funny witty characters while also ironically being a more mature show about the interpersonal relationships of a family on the verge of collapsing. It's funny, it's super heartwarming, it's sad, and it's also extremely smart with how it handles its characters. I had zero expectations going into the show when I first started watching it but as the years went on, it's become one of my favorite sitcoms out right now. I love the fact that it's not afraid to pull back the comedic punches and delve into more dramatic, mature themes. I think once the show ends people are going to look back and realize how surprisingly high of quality the writing is in the show and it's going to go down as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.

"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","So far - Unexpectedly Brilliant!","fung0","Anyone expecting 'more Big Bang' will be sorely disappointed by Young Sheldon. This is a very different kind of show - and a far, far better show than we had any right to expect. Young Sheldon could have been a quick cash-in on the huge popularity of Big Bang Theory. But it turns out to be a whole new thing, only loosely connected to the previous show.True, Young Sheldon does pick up the backstory established for the Sheldon of Big Bang. But the writing takes off in a whole new direction. Gone are the zippy one-liners, the exaggerated characters, the zaniness, What we get instead is something no one could have predicted: heart.It's a huge mistake to think of Young Sheldon as a prequel to Big Bang. Think of it, instead, as a 21st Century reboot of Leave It to Beaver. This is a slice-of-life story of growing up in Texas. Instead of being set-bound like Big Bang, Young Sheldon is shot largely on locations. Instead of being stylized, it's realistic. Instead of being glib, it's thoughtful. There's plenty of humor, but it's gentler and more complex.The third episode, for example, deals with a child coming to grip with the possible death of a parent, and with the role of faith in his very logical universe. The script doesn't judge, and it doesn't forget to be, at times, hilariously funny. (The last line had us in stitches.)The acting is uniformly superb. Sheldon's mom perfectly evokes Laurie Metcalf's older version from Big Bang. Annie Potts playing Sheldon's 'Meemaw' is as brilliant as she's ever been (and that's saying quite a lot.) And then there's Iaian Armitage in the title role. He doesn't mimic the older Sheldon, but he does ring absolutely true as a precocious yet naive kid, totally out of step with his surroundings. After watching him for a half-hour, I no longer cared whether he was supposed to be a younger version of some other character. He's a totally memorable character in his own right.Chuck Lorre has taken a huge risk, defying audience expectations with Young Sheldon. Let's hope he and Steven Molaro (who've co-written the early episodes) can keep the series going as powerfully as it has begun.

It remains to be seen what the future holds for Young Sheldon but by virtue of the nature of a prequel, it's future is probably our present. This is where the writing, directing and interpretation of the characters needs to tread carefully. 
Too many reviews in this forum were done after just episode 1. 
It's a great show with some old fashioned values. The chemistry between Sheldon and Missy is magic. Reagan (Missy) nearly steals the show. Zoe Perry deserves an Emmy. She nails the Mary role. As does Annie Potts with Meemaw. 
Let's face it, the ""fish out of water""premise has sustained comedy since there was comedy. The Three Stooges and the Marx brothers in high society. Check out Hoi Polloi and Night at the Opera as examples that typify the notion. Without ill fitting tuxes though, the Stooges would've worn thin. Without Margaret Dumont, the Marxes would've become tired quickly. Penny is the Big Bang's Dumont. Now in Young Sheldon, he himself is the Dumont amongst a horde of red necks, dummies and well intended warm working class folk. That's why it works for me. I sincerely hope the producers respect the short shelf life that this series has and resists any temptation to move away from the excellent formula the first season has created. It's a series that I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to do. Young Georgie is just as appealing as Sheldon. He's a brat but warm hearted enough not to dislike him. Missy is feisty without being precocious. Meemaw is earthy without being a lush. George likes his booze and BBQ's without being a loser. And Mary is the glue. Forget the millenials who's short attention spans have cheapened their taste. It's a great show. I can't get enough.","2 February 2018","10/10"
"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","Enjoyable","munchere-260-598799","I have a problem with the reviewers complaining about how Sheldon is such a brat and at the same time say they watch TBBT. If they watch that show then they must know Sheldon is a brat. In this show, though, we have a 9 year old version of a bratty Sheldon. In both cases he isn't bratty because he's spoiled or mean hearted. He's bratty because he's a genius and a social simpleton. That's the point. 
I Iiked the show right off but I can also say that it has improved as these brief, less than 30 minute, episodes are able to develop the characters and relationships more. One reviewer complained about the lack of character development after only watching the first show! 
I also think the actor playing young Sheldon is doing a great job. As with the adult Sheldon the young Sheldon is sincere, wants to be good, knows his own mind but also knows that he doesn't understand social norms and so listens to those close to him although he reserves the right to not accept those norms. I enjoy the family dynamic and the situations that arise because he's special. This family is much more realistic than the Malcom in the Middle family, a show one reviewer touted as being at a level this show couldn't come up to. The characters in MITM were ridiculously stupid. The characters in Young Sheldon each ha ve a unique personality and do things that you have seen others do or can imagine others doing, like Sheldon's brother trying chewing tobacco, repeatedly spitting it out in disgust then saying ""I must be doing something wrong"". 
The writing warms the heart as we watch a family moving past disagreements and difficulties caused by their special Sheldon - all realizing that they love him and he's family which is more important than those disagreements and difficulties.","27 September 2017","9/10"
"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","Sweet and funny","cherold","I was surprised how many people dislike the pilot. I thought it was an interesting idea done well. And now that I've watched six episodes, I feel fully justified in saying this is terrific television.The show centers on the childhood of The Big Bang Theory's high- functioning autistic genius Sheldon Cooper. Sheldon is a quirky savant in a very ordinary family with a religious mom and a puzzled dad. Too smart for his peers, the 9-year-old Sheldon is boosted to high school, where he promptly alienates everyone.Some people complain that Sheldon is too annoying, but why would you want a series about a young Sheldon if you didn't want to see someone annoying? I find the kid version less irritating, primarily because he is powerless and thus is not, like his adult counterpart, bullying and browbeating and insulting his friends to get his way. Young Sheldon is just trying to survive and, more importantly, learn.In fact, my main concern is that Sheldon seems a little too normal. He's got some funny habits and is a bit obsessive, but I would have expected someone far *more* obnoxious and weird. He really just seems precocious and socially clueless.I wasn't surprised that Sheldon is socially inept or sometimes rude - if you are, then once again I have to ask why on earth you watched this show. I was surprised at the sweetness of the series. Sheldon's mom is wonderfully understanding and supportive, and even his dad has occasional moments of rough, loving insight.Some people have said there aren't any jokes in this series, but it's actually very funny. No, there aren't any Catskills comics material, but if you think there are no jokes I think you just need the BBT's laugh track.","23 March 2018","8/10"

Maybe the reason so many people are disappointed is the huge difference in tone - and the fact that young Sheldon is way too cute.
While TBBT is more or less a nerdy version of Friends, Young Sheldon is more like a classic family comedy with typical family problems and the special task of raising an Asperger genius.
The key ingredients are the same as in TBBT though - fresh humor, well defined characters and a brilliant cast.

"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","This Show Has No Right To Be This Good","breneff","After the finale of this previous season, I finally have come to the realization that this is one of the better sitcoms I have seen in a very, very, very long time. Let me just start off by saying that I never got into big bang theory. I had friends who were really into it, but whenever I watched it I just saw it as cringe nerd humor by people who weren't actually nerds... Or that's what I thought at the time. As time has gone on, I realize that there's a lot more inside jokes, and deeper moments in that show... and the reason why I've come around to it is 100% because of a Young Sheldon. It takes the best parts of Big Bang Theory and gets rid of the cringey laugh track style comedy for a more dry and intelligent sense of humor and extremely funny witty characters while also ironically being a more mature show about the interpersonal relationships of a family on the verge of collapsing. It's funny, it's super heartwarming, it's sad, and it's also extremely smart with how it handles its characters. I had zero expectations going into the show when I first started watching it but as the years went on, it's become one of my favorite sitcoms out right now. I love the fact that it's not afraid to pull back the comedic punches and delve into more dramatic, mature themes. I think once the show ends people are going to look back and realize how surprisingly high of quality the writing is in the show and it's going to go down as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.

"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","So far - Unexpectedly Brilliant!","fung0","Anyone expecting 'more Big Bang' will be sorely disappointed by Young Sheldon. This is a very different kind of show - and a far, far better show than we had any right to expect. Young Sheldon could have been a quick cash-in on the huge popularity of Big Bang Theory. But it turns out to be a whole new thing, only loosely connected to the previous show.True, Young Sheldon does pick up the backstory established for the Sheldon of Big Bang. But the writing takes off in a whole new direction. Gone are the zippy one-liners, the exaggerated characters, the zaniness, What we get instead is something no one could have predicted: heart.It's a huge mistake to think of Young Sheldon as a prequel to Big Bang. Think of it, instead, as a 21st Century reboot of Leave It to Beaver. This is a slice-of-life story of growing up in Texas. Instead of being set-bound like Big Bang, Young Sheldon is shot largely on locations. Instead of being stylized, it's realistic. Instead of being glib, it's thoughtful. There's plenty of humor, but it's gentler and more complex.The third episode, for example, deals with a child coming to grip with the possible death of a parent, and with the role of faith in his very logical universe. The script doesn't judge, and it doesn't forget to be, at times, hilariously funny. (The last line had us in stitches.)The acting is uniformly superb. Sheldon's mom perfectly evokes Laurie Metcalf's older version from Big Bang. Annie Potts playing Sheldon's 'Meemaw' is as brilliant as she's ever been (and that's saying quite a lot.) And then there's Iaian Armitage in the title role. He doesn't mimic the older Sheldon, but he does ring absolutely true as a precocious yet naive kid, totally out of step with his surroundings. After watching him for a half-hour, I no longer cared whether he was supposed to be a younger version of some other character. He's a totally memorable character in his own right.Chuck Lorre has taken a huge risk, defying audience expectations with Young Sheldon. Let's hope he and Steven Molaro (who've co-written the early episodes) can keep the series going as powerfully as it has begun. And hope also that audiences can shake off their addiction to Big Bang Theory long enough to appreciate something that's as fresh and ground-breaking today as Big Bang was eleven years ago.","20 November 2022","9/10"

Don't get me wrong I have been watching TBBT from day one and will continue to watch it, but Young Sheldon is much much funnier.Like another reviewer stated, it must have been a huge chore trying to find a child to play Young Sheldon, but they have done a fantastic job.

"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","This Show Has No Right To Be This Good","breneff","After the finale of this previous season, I finally have come to the realization that this is one of the better sitcoms I have seen in a very, very, very long time. Let me just start off by saying that I never got into big bang theory. I had friends who were really into it, but whenever I watched it I just saw it as cringe nerd humor by people who weren't actually nerds... Or that's what I thought at the time. As time has gone on, I realize that there's a lot more inside jokes, and deeper moments in that show... and the reason why I've come around to it is 100% because of a Young Sheldon. It takes the best parts of Big Bang Theory and gets rid of the cringey laugh track style comedy for a more dry and intelligent sense of humor and extremely funny witty characters while also ironically being a more mature show about the interpersonal relationships of a family on the verge of collapsing. It's funny, it's super heartwarming, it's sad, and it's also extremely smart with how it handles its characters. I had zero expectations going into the show when I first started watching it but as the years went on, it's become one of my favorite sitcoms out right now. I love the fact that it's not afraid to pull back the comedic punches and delve into more dramatic, mature themes. I think once the show ends people are going to look back and realize how surprisingly high of quality the writing is in the show and it's going to go down as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.

"Young Sheldon (2017–2024)","So far - Unexpectedly Brilliant!","fung0","Anyone expecting 'more Big Bang' will be sorely disappointed by Young Sheldon. This is a very different kind of show - and a far, far better show than we had any right to expect. Young Sheldon could have been a quick cash-in on the huge popularity of Big Bang Theory. But it turns out to be a whole new thing, only loosely connected to the previous show.True, Young Sheldon does pick up the backstory established for the Sheldon of Big Bang. But the writing takes off in a whole new direction. Gone are the zippy one-liners, the exaggerated characters, the zaniness, What we get instead is something no one could have predicted: heart.It's a huge mistake to think of Young Sheldon as a prequel to Big Bang. Think of it, instead, as a 21st Century reboot of Leave It to Beaver. This is a slice-of-life story of growing up in Texas. Instead of being set-bound like Big Bang, Young Sheldon is shot largely on locations. Instead of being stylized, it's realistic. Instead of being glib, it's thoughtful. There's plenty of humor, but it's gentler and more complex.The third episode, for example, deals with a child coming to grip with the possible death of a parent, and with the role of faith in his very logical universe. The script doesn't judge, and it doesn't forget to be, at times, hilariously funny. (The last line had us in stitches.)The acting is uniformly superb. Sheldon's mom perfectly evokes Laurie Metcalf's older version from Big Bang. Annie Potts playing Sheldon's 'Meemaw' is as brilliant as she's ever been (and that's saying quite a lot.) And then there's Iaian Armitage in the title role. He doesn't mimic the older Sheldon, but he does ring absolutely true as a precocious yet naive kid, totally out of step with his surroundings. After watching him for a half-hour, I no longer cared whether he was supposed to be a younger version of some other character. He's a totally memorable character in his own right.Chuck Lorre has taken a huge risk, defying audience expectations with Young Sheldon. Let's hope he and Steven Molaro (who've co-written the early episodes) can keep the series going as powerfully as it has begun. And hope also that audiences can shake off their addiction to Big Bang Theory long enough to appreciate something that's as fresh and ground-breaking today as Big Bang was eleven years ago.","20 November 2022","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

And I overall liked it and think it was well made, so I'm rounding my score up to reflect that. But it somehow didn't completely land for me, in a way that I find hard to explain.I think it was the domestic drama part of the film that didn't completely work for me. The movie spends a lot of time on all the ways that Jeffrey Wright feels overwhelmed by his life's responsibilities, and it sags in some of these parts, and makes the movie feel a little bit like a slog. And I don't know that I ever completely believed the character played by Sterling K. Brown, who never seemed convincing as a gay man. But I did like what the film had to say about the burden placed on black people to constantly be representing black people everywhere that white people never have to deal with.

"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","satire at it's best","ferguson-6","This film was hilarious. I laughed more than I have during a movie in a long time. The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"

What was supposed to be a satirical commentary turns into something more than he ever expected.This film is an adaptation of the novel Erasure by Percival Everett. The film is a good mix of drama and comedy. One storyline makes fun of how, even though society is becoming more accepting of minorities, it unintentionally marginalizes them by continuing to perpetuate stereotypes. At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society. This is a great film to watch with friends and discuss afterward.","13 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

The movie spends a lot of time on all the ways that Jeffrey Wright feels overwhelmed by his life's responsibilities, and it sags in some of these parts, and makes the movie feel a little bit like a slog. And I don't know that I ever completely believed the character played by Sterling K. Brown, who never seemed convincing as a gay man. But I did like what the film had to say about the burden placed on black people to constantly be representing black people everywhere that white people never have to deal with.

"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"

The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope.

"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

He just kept me laughing every time he was on the screen.American Fiction makes a lot of points without needing to take a side and was more about the character development of Thelonious Ellison played by Jeffery Wright as he deals with life and his family.This movie has a lot of substance to it, from the smallest sub plot that was just as engaging to go through as the main one.

"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

The movie spends a lot of time on all the ways that Jeffrey Wright feels overwhelmed by his life's responsibilities, and it sags in some of these parts, and makes the movie feel a little bit like a slog. And I don't know that I ever completely believed the character played by Sterling K. Brown, who never seemed convincing as a gay man. But I did like what the film had to say about the burden placed on black people to constantly be representing black people everywhere that white people never have to deal with.

"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","satire at it's best","ferguson-6","This film was hilarious. I laughed more than I have during a movie in a long time. The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Earnest drama first, satire second","masonsaul","An author, dejected by the state of society and what readers consider black literature, decides to give the people what they want: a stereotypical black story. What was supposed to be a satirical commentary turns into something more than he ever expected.This film is an adaptation of the novel Erasure by Percival Everett. The film is a good mix of drama and comedy. One storyline makes fun of how, even though society is becoming more accepting of minorities, it unintentionally marginalizes them by continuing to perpetuate stereotypes. At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society. This is a great film to watch with friends and discuss afterward.","13 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her.

Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story.

It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","satire at it's best","ferguson-6","This film was hilarious. I laughed more than I have during a movie in a long time. The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Earnest drama first, satire second","masonsaul","An author, dejected by the state of society and what readers consider black literature, decides to give the people what they want: a stereotypical black story. What was supposed to be a satirical commentary turns into something more than he ever expected.This film is an adaptation of the novel Erasure by Percival Everett. The film is a good mix of drama and comedy. One storyline makes fun of how, even though society is becoming more accepting of minorities, it unintentionally marginalizes them by continuing to perpetuate stereotypes. At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society. This is a great film to watch with friends and discuss afterward.","13 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Needed Either Better Balance Or More Comedic Focus","zkonedog","It was a good time at the movies going to see American Fiction. It's not a story that I have not heard in some form or fashion before but the dramatic content made it fresh over just being a comedy.Speaking of comedy Sterling K. Brown was hilarious in the film. He just kept me laughing every time he was on the screen.American Fiction makes a lot of points without needing to take a side and was more about the character development of Thelonious Ellison played by Jeffery Wright as he deals with life and his family.This movie has a lot of substance to it, from the smallest sub plot that was just as engaging to go through as the main one. Its a very complete film.","7 January 2024","6/10"
"Hazbin Hotel (2019)","Amazing pilot","CriticalOfEverything","I've been following this show's development and progress for 2 out of the 4 years it was being made for, and now that it's finally out I can say that it exceeded every expectation I had for it. Not only was the animation beautiful to look at, but the entire thing was so ridiculously absurd and full of life. The characters are likable and very entertaining, my favourite probably being Alastor. The writing was also spot on. While it may have relied a little too heavily on swearing at points, the whole concept of it being set in hell kind of acts as leeway for that, along with the cartoony expressions, sexual nature of some of the characters, etc. But there were certainly a lot of funny moments in this pilot, in fact I had a massive smile on my face the whole time Alastor was on screen. There was a clear emotional center as well at points, so it was nice to see an adult show that wasn't ONLY centered on raunchy comedy. The music and songs were fantastic too, filled with a lot of energy, helped by the amazing voice cast. All the voice actors/actresses did a superb job and no one slacked off in the slightest.

The characters are likable and very entertaining, my favourite probably being Alastor. The writing was also spot on. While it may have relied a little too heavily on swearing at points, the whole concept of it being set in hell kind of acts as leeway for that, along with the cartoony expressions, sexual nature of some of the characters, etc. But there were certainly a lot of funny moments in this pilot, in fact I had a massive smile on my face the whole time Alastor was on screen. There was a clear emotional center as well at points, so it was nice to see an adult show that wasn't ONLY centered on raunchy comedy. The music and songs were fantastic too, filled with a lot of energy, helped by the amazing voice cast. All the voice actors/actresses did a superb job and no one slacked off in the slightest.

It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong!

And combined with Part 1, we have one of the greatest adaptations in genre literature history.It's clear everyone on set was aware that they were working on something special here - because literally every single person in this production have brought their A-Game for a truly incredible technical achievement. And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film..

"Dune: Part Two (2024)","Arrakis is Real. Believe Me I've Seen It.","HalBanksy","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.","26 February 2024","10/10"
"Dune: Part Two (2024)","The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Epic of our Generation","Dvir971","If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene.

Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1.

And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film..

"Dune: Part Two (2024)","Arrakis is Real. Believe Me I've Seen It.","HalBanksy","Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.","26 February 2024","10/10"

Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Outer Space meets Inner Space","NinaCu","I understand that a lot of people probably rated this low because they saw that it starred Adam Sandler and came into it expecting Happy Gilmore. I did not. I am a sci-fi enthusiast, and I cut my teeth on some of the great, old masterpieces of the '50s and '60s -- many of them by Czech authors, just like this one was! These novels and films were ones that modern audiences might see as ""dry"" these days, but they were hard-core sci-fi that packed an emotional punch while telling a story of speculative fiction -- a world that ""advanced the timeline"" from our own to see how the human psyche, human morality, human frailty, would cope with advances in technology. And that's exactly what we have here -- a Czech astronaut put in an extraordinary circumstance, even fantastical by the standards of our ""real world."" And yet, the actual story isn't fantastical at all -- it's a simple question of the human heart, and the meaning of life. In that way, it's not so different from a one-act, heavy-dialogue drama... but by framing it as a science fiction film, we can strip out any modern-day distractions and just focus on human nature in its purest form.And maybe enjoy Paul Dano's absolutely riveting performance as a giant arachnid alien!This is a must-see for any lover of ""pure"" sci-fi or ""old-school"" sci-fi. 8/10.","2 March 2024","9/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Pure, old-school, trippy sci-fi","AlienRobotZombieOverlord","Wow, what a trip! This movie is profound, funny and extremely original. This film is about humanity, what happens when we deny our emotions and turn to empty heroic pursuits. This film is about everything and nothing, time, space and most importantly - the intergalactic appeal of hazelnut chocolate spread. It's also about an incredibly wise, giant spider with cute little teeth.It has a touch of David Lynch about it, especially with the Isabella Rossellini factor. It navigates the uneasy edge of menace and humour, but with a plot that actually makes sense.It also reminded me of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind with the retro fittings, brick phone, and chunky eastern block tech, placing the film both in the future and the past at the same time.Bravo for making a film about space that isn't about space or man's burning ambition to beat the odds. Bravo for making a film that is less than two hours long and never gets boring. Bravo for doing something entirely different and putting two actors together I never thought I'd see in the same frame.After seeing Adam Sandler in Hidden Gems I became a fan, and I'm an even bigger one now, and Carey Mulligan is excellent, as usual. Although I have to say if anything annoyed me in the film it was the age difference between Carey Mulligan's character and her mother. The mother looked perhaps 10 years older than the daughter, max... how's that work...? Same old same old. The reluctance to cast older-looking, age appropriate women in this industry continues...Lots of people won't like this movie. For many reasons. If you're expecting a film about mr big dick beating the odds in a tin can you'll be be sadly disappointed.

Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really.

These novels and films were ones that modern audiences might see as ""dry"" these days, but they were hard-core sci-fi that packed an emotional punch while telling a story of speculative fiction -- a world that ""advanced the timeline"" from our own to see how the human psyche, human morality, human frailty, would cope with advances in technology.

And yet, the actual story isn't fantastical at all -- it's a simple question of the human heart, and the meaning of life. In that way, it's not so different from a one-act, heavy-dialogue drama... but by framing it as a science fiction film, we can strip out any modern-day distractions and just focus on human nature in its purest form.And maybe enjoy Paul Dano's absolutely riveting performance as a giant arachnid alien!This is a must-see for any lover of ""pure"" sci-fi or ""old-school"" sci-fi. 8/10.","2 March 2024","9/10"

This film is about humanity, what happens when we deny our emotions and turn to empty heroic pursuits. This film is about everything and nothing, time, space and most importantly - the intergalactic appeal of hazelnut chocolate spread. It's also about an incredibly wise, giant spider with cute little teeth.It has a touch of David Lynch about it, especially with the Isabella Rossellini factor. It navigates the uneasy edge of menace and humour, but with a plot that actually makes sense.It also reminded me of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind with the retro fittings, brick phone, and chunky eastern block tech, placing the film both in the future and the past at the same time.Bravo for making a film about space that isn't about space or man's burning ambition to beat the odds. Bravo for making a film that is less than two hours long and never gets boring. Bravo for doing something entirely different and putting two actors together I never thought I'd see in the same frame.After seeing Adam Sandler in Hidden Gems I became a fan, and I'm an even bigger one now, and Carey Mulligan is excellent, as usual. Although I have to say if anything annoyed me in the film it was the age difference between Carey Mulligan's character and her mother. The mother looked perhaps 10 years older than the daughter, max... how's that work...? Same old same old. The reluctance to cast older-looking, age appropriate women in this industry continues...Lots of people won't like this movie. For many reasons. If you're expecting a film about mr big dick beating the odds in a tin can you'll be be sadly disappointed.

Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach.

And... that is precisely why the Earth is full of problems caused by human infestation -- to quote V-ger (ST:TMP).Movies addressing psychological issues and motifs are gaining traction in the movie industry, and can make quite a profit -- such as Barbie.For the rest of us who are open to considering what lay beyond our inner limitations, this is an absolutely wonderful movie, perfectly juxtaposing innerspace with outerspace, and the cyclical dichotomy of the end being the beginning, at multiple levels. The direction and editing establish an absolutely perfect pace for the premise of solo space travel and introspection, analogous to Silent Running (1972). The set design is remarkably plausible.Last but not least, this is the best performance by Adam Sandler since Punch Drunk Love (2002). And the irony in this movie is that when Sandler overcomes whatever issues keep him from taking on deep and serious roles -- in a manner similar to the character he plays in this movie -- he is absolutely amazing in revealing the gift of his own personal depth.(Minus one star for psychological issues not written by, or without consultation of, psychology experts.)","2 March 2024","7/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Outer Space meets Inner Space","NinaCu","I understand that a lot of people probably rated this low because they saw that it starred Adam Sandler and came into it expecting Happy Gilmore. I did not. I am a sci-fi enthusiast, and I cut my teeth on some of the great, old masterpieces of the '50s and '60s -- many of them by Czech authors, just like this one was! These novels and films were ones that modern audiences might see as ""dry"" these days, but they were hard-core sci-fi that packed an emotional punch while telling a story of speculative fiction -- a world that ""advanced the timeline"" from our own to see how the human psyche, human morality, human frailty, would cope with advances in technology. And that's exactly what we have here -- a Czech astronaut put in an extraordinary circumstance, even fantastical by the standards of our ""real world."" And yet, the actual story isn't fantastical at all -- it's a simple question of the human heart, and the meaning of life. In that way, it's not so different from a one-act, heavy-dialogue drama... but by framing it as a science fiction film, we can strip out any modern-day distractions and just focus on human nature in its purest form.And maybe enjoy Paul Dano's absolutely riveting performance as a giant arachnid alien!This is a must-see for any lover of ""pure"" sci-fi or ""old-school"" sci-fi. 8/10.","2 March 2024","9/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Pure, old-school, trippy sci-fi","AlienRobotZombieOverlord","Wow, what a trip! This movie is profound, funny and extremely original. This film is about humanity, what happens when we deny our emotions and turn to empty heroic pursuits. This film is about everything and nothing, time, space and most importantly - the intergalactic appeal of hazelnut chocolate spread. It's also about an incredibly wise, giant spider with cute little teeth.It has a touch of David Lynch about it, especially with the Isabella Rossellini factor. It navigates the uneasy edge of menace and humour, but with a plot that actually makes sense.It also reminded me of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind with the retro fittings, brick phone, and chunky eastern block tech, placing the film both in the future and the past at the same time.Bravo for making a film about space that isn't about space or man's burning ambition to beat the odds. Bravo for making a film that is less than two hours long and never gets boring. Bravo for doing something entirely different and putting two actors together I never thought I'd see in the same frame.After seeing Adam Sandler in Hidden Gems I became a fan, and I'm an even bigger one now, and Carey Mulligan is excellent, as usual. Although I have to say if anything annoyed me in the film it was the age difference between Carey Mulligan's character and her mother. The mother looked perhaps 10 years older than the daughter, max... how's that work...? Same old same old. The reluctance to cast older-looking, age appropriate women in this industry continues...Lots of people won't like this movie. For many reasons. If you're expecting a film about mr big dick beating the odds in a tin can you'll be be sadly disappointed. However, if you're up for the most excellent man-hugging-spider scene in the history of film, you'll be well pleased.I haven't watched Chernobyl but I definitely will now!","1 March 2024","8/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Who doesn't love chocolate hazelnut spread?","scopesclare","I've seen this movie before; it's called Ad Astra. Ambitious, but emotionally absent(and inconsiderate, I guess) husband leaves perfect wife behind to go on vital space mission. In both movies, the man is plagued by memories of a deeply flawed father, leaving them emotionally scarred and unable to reciprocate their perfect wives' love.While in Ad Astra, Brad Pitt's character discovers his shortcomings pieces at a time: though memory, experience, and various encounters - here, they forgo all nuance. We simply have a spider companion who directly and endlessly tells Adam Sandler what an ass he is to his wife. But both movies share one emotional theme: fathers suck and their sons are not much better. Relationships are all about men needing to open up more. This is not so bad by itself. But I've seen this in so many movies and TV shows by now it's starting to get tiresome. With all the fancy camera-work, heavy performances, and ambient music, this story still just beats you over the head with it's message without offering anything other than an overused cliché.Other movies in the past have a truly more nuanced approach. Try Solaris(either version), for example. I appreciate the production of this film, really. It's just that this come off as a feminist fantasy rather than good science fiction.","2 March 2024","9/10"

"Spaceman (I) (2024)","When Project Hail Mary comes out...","andrewwhite-32749","2 out of 5 stars.Spaceman is a bad science fiction drama film that puts Adam Sandler into another serious sci fi drama. Sadly, the film is very boring and slow. It is no Space Odyssey, or interstellar or the Abyss with some ideas from all of them.Plot is dull. Adam Sandler is travelling through the far reaches of space to investigate a storm cloud. While he is being affected psychologically. Until he meets a spider like alien that helps him through it. While he remembers his past about his wife.Script is dull. And direction is tedious and dry. There is not one exciting moment or something that will be worth talking about. Adam Sandler did his best. The film is not memorable.","2 March 2024","7/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","With, or without the space, it's the same old story.","johnnysokko","Don't get me wrong, this is a very well made film with decent acting, good CGI, some beautiful cinematography and an interesting premise about loneliness, loss and mental illness. However the script, the plot and the pacing simply kill any momentum that the movie tries to have.It is definitely a cure for insomnia.The movie ends up being a series of moments of Adam Sandlers life that an imaginary spider whispers to him. Seriously.The first 15 minutes are at least vaguely interesting, but all the bits with Carey Mulligan are dull.I love grown up sci-fi, but this movie definitely jumps the shark, or in this case the spider.","3 March 2024","5/10"
"Spaceman (I) (2024)","Space Spider Marriage Counseling","mesaxi","I thought this was a great film. I'm too lazy to write something profound here but if you get a chance to read the book first please do. Most reviews I've seen seem to recognize that this was adapted from the book, yet none of them really seem familiar with it. This is not a book vs movie argument but rather an acknowledgement of that source material. Really well done film and incredible Sandler performance. Dano is exactly what I imagined for Hanus. There is something that makes this so much better when you know what you're getting into. As this will be on Netflix in a week, we're about to be bombarded with user/critic reviews that won't reflect the quality of the film because their expectations were something profoundly different.","3 March 2024","5/10"

"Shōgun (2024)","Excellent","DiCaprioFan1","I can't recommend Shogun enough! This is one of those rare shows that's a must watch. It takes place in Japan during the 1600' where Lord Yoshii Torango is turned on by Council of Regents and they try to kill him and his people. Then he finds a mysterious European ship marooned with its crew in a nearby village and everything changes from what he finds on it. This series has the look and feel of a blockbuster movie. Its world building, character development and attention to detail is as good as anything you'll see in tv. FX usually does a great job with its shows and Shogun is no different. I'll be shocked if this isn't nominated for several awards.","27 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","An amazing television achievement but different from the book","Kevin-42","This is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.Knowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.However, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.Bottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.","28 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Highly recommended","0U","I've just finished the first two episodes and I cannot wait for more! The atmosphere, plot, acting are superlative. The politicking and scheming are prime Game of Thrones but I hate making that comparison as I want this show to stand on its own. The scheming between the various lords and the Portuguese faction is titillating and suspenseful as we watch various characters play the game. I love it! I cannot wait for next week. I haven't felt this way about a show in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy top tier drama.Funny to see most one star review being uneducated people who complain about subtitles.Japanese should never be dubbed. If you can't read, move to something your level like barbie.","27 February 2024","10/10"

"Shōgun (2024)","Decent Remake","Turanic","I am a fan of the old Shogun from 1980 with
Richard Chamberlain , so I enjoy the retelling of the original story big time... So far the story follows quite precisely which is a good thing... The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch...","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Actually spectacular","greenmangreat","When I first heard about this show, I figured it would just be another cringeworthy Western depiction of Shogunate Japan. But then I read about the glowing reviews, and decided to determine the accuracy of those reviews myself. And my my, this show is indeed amazing.I've never heard of the book, much less read it, but as a fan of world history, I found the depiction of the political intricacies of feudal Japan to be fascinating.2 episodes in, and I hadn't even realised how fast the time had gone. I just found myself glued to the screen from start to finish. Such fantastic work from a talented cast of actors. What a shame that this is only going to be a limited series!","29 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","To anyone who remembers the 1980's Richard Chamberlain ""Shogun""...","Broccolidwarf","...this is not that.While it was certainly groundbreaking and a huge hit at the time, in retrospect great parts of it was rather cheasy and cheapish.The 2024 version feels a great deal more modern and budgeted bigger, it's rougher, it's dirtier, the action scenes are crafted much better, the camera work is better, and so far the script seems better than the original series, with better dialogue allowing the characters more complexity and debth, which is especially important to American and European audiences, when depicting a very ""foreign"" culture.I should mention this is based off the first 2 episodes, so we are yet to see large scale battle scenes, but looking at the teaser clips, they look exellent, so I am hopefull.It's a show that - even after 2 episodes - makes you annoyed it is a limited series, by nature of James Clavell having written only one novel on feudal Japan.. but I actually predict this will be such a big hit, that FX will attempt to have scripts written for either a prequal, continuation - or spin offs - because that period of Japanese history is ripe with potential - and come on, who doesn't like samurai's?This is one of the ""must see"" shows of the year, where you will feel left out if you miss it.Enjoy :)","11 March 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Brilliant","Supermanfan-13","Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. My excitement grew even more when I saw the trailer. On top that it's gotten great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be a let down but it's not. It's everything I'd hoped and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne and his crew as they help Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. I've enjoyed every second of this.","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Top notch so far","terrylarosa","So the first two episodes have introduced us to many of the characters and set up for the intricate plot. Looks like latter episodes will have the bulk of the action. Tremendous sets, costumes and scenery are giving this a lot of authenticity. Coincidentally for me Sanada ( who almost always elevates anything he's in ) is my current favorite Japanese actor and Toshiro Mifune who played the same character in the 80's version was my favorite Japanese actor then. The actress playing Mariko is doing a much better job than she did in Monarch. As for the Blackthorne actor and character I too like others found his voice off putting but now I'm used to it. I kept trying to figure who he sounded like and then realized he sounds ( as the character ) like Richard Burton who I saw in a movie the other day. His character also began as unlikable and arrogant but am now beginning to like more. I hope this wins many awards and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the series.

"Shōgun (2024)","Amazing series","Beske","Everything is just spot on with this series!I get that Americans aren't used to reading subtitles, but come on. So what if the series is mostly in Japanese? It's about an English man stuck in Japan in the 17th century. Why wouldn't it be in Japanese?The acting, staging, camera shots, editing, direction - everything is 10 out of 10.I rarely give a 10 after just two episodes, but this is an amazing series. I rarely give anything a ten. This is probably one of the best series I've seen the last ten years.Mark my words - this'll get an Emmy for sure! If you haven't watched it, be sure to do. It's exciting, full of history and just a gem to watch.","28 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Excellent","DiCaprioFan1","I can't recommend Shogun enough! This is one of those rare shows that's a must watch. It takes place in Japan during the 1600' where Lord Yoshii Torango is turned on by Council of Regents and they try to kill him and his people. Then he finds a mysterious European ship marooned with its crew in a nearby village and everything changes from what he finds on it. This series has the look and feel of a blockbuster movie. Its world building, character development and attention to detail is as good as anything you'll see in tv. FX usually does a great job with its shows and Shogun is no different. I'll be shocked if this isn't nominated for several awards.","27 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","An amazing television achievement but different from the book","Kevin-42","This is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.Knowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.However, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.Bottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.","28 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Highly recommended","0U","I've just finished the first two episodes and I cannot wait for more! The atmosphere, plot, acting are superlative. The politicking and scheming are prime Game of Thrones but I hate making that comparison as I want this show to stand on its own. The scheming between the various lords and the Portuguese faction is titillating and suspenseful as we watch various characters play the game. I love it! I cannot wait for next week. I haven't felt this way about a show in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy top tier drama.Funny to see most one star review being uneducated people who complain about subtitles.Japanese should never be dubbed. If you can't read, move to something your level like barbie.","27 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Brilliant !","thelastapasenger","This was a most waiting tv series for 2024! And it is true! The two first episodes were just perfect! Mr Sanada is perfect to his role as lord toranaga as perfect are the two allies ( blackthorne and mariko)!We have a short story at the beginning to understand the culture of feudal japan at 1590 as the teaser trailer released two weeks ago !Customs , cgi , has many details ( shoes , helmets, armor, etc) as it was at 1600 bc at feudal japan !Story is writen on japan culture as well!So far so perfect! Its truly based to james clavel novel more than 80s series ! Waiting for the next episodes to see !","27 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Decent Remake","Turanic","I am a fan of the old Shogun from 1980 with
Richard Chamberlain , so I enjoy the retelling of the original story big time... So far the story follows quite precisely which is a good thing... The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch...","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Actually spectacular","greenmangreat","When I first heard about this show, I figured it would just be another cringeworthy Western depiction of Shogunate Japan.

And my my, this show is indeed amazing.I've never heard of the book, much less read it, but as a fan of world history, I found the depiction of the political intricacies of feudal Japan to be fascinating.2 episodes in, and I hadn't even realised how fast the time had gone. I just found myself glued to the screen from start to finish. Such fantastic work from a talented cast of actors.

"Shōgun (2024)","Brilliant","Supermanfan-13","Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. My excitement grew even more when I saw the trailer. On top that it's gotten great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be a let down but it's not. It's everything I'd hoped and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne and his crew as they help Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. I've enjoyed every second of this.","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Top notch so far","terrylarosa","So the first two episodes have introduced us to many of the characters and set up for the intricate plot. Looks like latter episodes will have the bulk of the action. Tremendous sets, costumes and scenery are giving this a lot of authenticity. Coincidentally for me Sanada ( who almost always elevates anything he's in ) is my current favorite Japanese actor and Toshiro Mifune who played the same character in the 80's version was my favorite Japanese actor then. The actress playing Mariko is doing a much better job than she did in Monarch. As for the Blackthorne actor and character I too like others found his voice off putting but now I'm used to it. I kept trying to figure who he sounded like and then realized he sounds ( as the character ) like Richard Burton who I saw in a movie the other day. His character also began as unlikable and arrogant but am now beginning to like more. I hope this wins many awards and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the series.

Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.Bottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.","28 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Highly recommended","0U","I've just finished the first two episodes and I cannot wait for more! The atmosphere, plot, acting are superlative. The politicking and scheming are prime Game of Thrones but I hate making that comparison as I want this show to stand on its own. The scheming between the various lords and the Portuguese faction is titillating and suspenseful as we watch various characters play the game. I love it! I cannot wait for next week. I haven't felt this way about a show in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy top tier drama.Funny to see most one star review being uneducated people who complain about subtitles.Japanese should never be dubbed. If you can't read, move to something your level like barbie.","27 February 2024","10/10"

Mr Sanada is perfect to his role as lord toranaga as perfect are the two allies ( blackthorne and mariko)!We have a short story at the beginning to understand the culture of feudal japan at 1590 as the teaser trailer released two weeks ago !Customs , cgi , has many details ( shoes , helmets, armor, etc) as it was at 1600 bc at feudal japan !Story is writen on japan culture as well!So far so perfect!

"Shōgun (2024)","Decent Remake","Turanic","I am a fan of the old Shogun from 1980 with
Richard Chamberlain , so I enjoy the retelling of the original story big time... So far the story follows quite precisely which is a good thing... The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch...","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Actually spectacular","greenmangreat","When I first heard about this show, I figured it would just be another cringeworthy Western depiction of Shogunate Japan. But then I read about the glowing reviews, and decided to determine the accuracy of those reviews myself. And my my, this show is indeed amazing.I've never heard of the book, much less read it, but as a fan of world history, I found the depiction of the political intricacies of feudal Japan to be fascinating.2 episodes in, and I hadn't even realised how fast the time had gone. I just found myself glued to the screen from start to finish. Such fantastic work from a talented cast of actors. What a shame that this is only going to be a limited series!","29 February 2024","9/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","To anyone who remembers the 1980's Richard Chamberlain ""Shogun""...","Broccolidwarf","...this is not that.While it was certainly groundbreaking and a huge hit at the time, in retrospect great parts of it was rather cheasy and cheapish.The 2024 version feels a great deal more modern and budgeted bigger, it's rougher, it's dirtier, the action scenes are crafted much better, the camera work is better, and so far the script seems better than the original series, with better dialogue allowing the characters more complexity and debth, which is especially important to American and European audiences, when depicting a very ""foreign"" culture.I should mention this is based off the first 2 episodes, so we are yet to see large scale battle scenes, but looking at the teaser clips, they look exellent, so I am hopefull.It's a show that - even after 2 episodes - makes you annoyed it is a limited series, by nature of James Clavell having written only one novel on feudal Japan.. but I actually predict this will be such a big hit, that FX will attempt to have scripts written for either a prequal, continuation - or spin offs - because that period of Japanese history is ripe with potential - and come on, who doesn't like samurai's?This is one of the ""must see"" shows of the year, where you will feel left out if you miss it.Enjoy :)","11 March 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Brilliant","Supermanfan-13","Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. My excitement grew even more when I saw the trailer. On top that it's gotten great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be a let down but it's not. It's everything I'd hoped and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne and his crew as they help Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. I've enjoyed every second of this.","28 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Top notch so far","terrylarosa","So the first two episodes have introduced us to many of the characters and set up for the intricate plot. Looks like latter episodes will have the bulk of the action. Tremendous sets, costumes and scenery are giving this a lot of authenticity. Coincidentally for me Sanada ( who almost always elevates anything he's in ) is my current favorite Japanese actor and Toshiro Mifune who played the same character in the 80's version was my favorite Japanese actor then. The actress playing Mariko is doing a much better job than she did in Monarch. As for the Blackthorne actor and character I too like others found his voice off putting but now I'm used to it. I kept trying to figure who he sounded like and then realized he sounds ( as the character ) like Richard Burton who I saw in a movie the other day. His character also began as unlikable and arrogant but am now beginning to like more. I hope this wins many awards and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the series. The subtitles do not bother me as I'm an avid reader and watch all shows and movies with subtitles anyway so I never miss any dialogue. It gets one less star because I thought the two eps could have used a bit more intensity but I'm sure that will be rectified soon enough.","27 February 2024","10/10"
"Shōgun (2024)","Amazing series","Beske","Everything is just spot on with this series!I get that Americans aren't used to reading subtitles, but come on. So what if the series is mostly in Japanese? It's about an English man stuck in Japan in the 17th century. Why wouldn't it be in Japanese?The acting, staging, camera shots, editing, direction - everything is 10 out of 10.I rarely give a 10 after just two episodes, but this is an amazing series. I rarely give anything a ten. This is probably one of the best series I've seen the last ten years.Mark my words - this'll get an Emmy for sure! If you haven't watched it, be sure to do. It's exciting, full of history and just a gem to watch.","28 February 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","It's an excellent movie.","Sleepin_Dragon","The real life story of The Uruguayan rugby team and friends, who's plane crashed into a glacier over The Andes.It's been many years since I watched Alive, a harrowing, but interesting film. I must admit I was staggered by just how good this film was. Upsetting, thought provoking, at times hard to watch, but one I couldn't turn away from.It is very sensitively handled, the story is told in a very human way, they don't focus on the bleaker side of the story too much, so we're not forced to watch the more unsavoury parts, instead they focus more on the human spirit, the fight for survival.I was worried that it would feel over long at 2.5 hours, but at no point did it dip, it went by very quickly.It's very nicely produced, it looks so good, my advice, watch in its original form, with the subtitles, it's so much better.Impressive.9/10.","7 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Netflix strikes a hit with this enthralling true life drama","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","There's a film about the Uruguayan rugby team crash landing in the Andes in the 70s. Alive. It's very good. Do we need another film telling the story? Well for starters this is all in Spanish, which makes it feel more authentic and there's more build up and back story. We get to know the players a little bit more, but still it doesn't wait too long to board the plane. They're off to play a match in Santiago. Taking off from Uruguay, the weather is good, the colours are vibrant. It looks beautiful. Everyone's happy. Excited. Smiling. Adventure awaits. Just not the one expected. They're kids on a plane. Jovial, having fun, until they're not. Do not watch this if you're due to fly soon. It is absolutely terrifying. The crash sequence is viseral. Chaotic. Flesh and metal twisted together. Blood. Bone. Panic. It's honestly a blessing to be killed rather than survive. Some do though of course and set out on an unimaginable hell. The night hits, the temperatures drop, how on earth do you comprehend the pain and anguish they endure. We can't of course, but Society of the Snow does help to give us a sense, at least visually even if we can't truly understand the hellish madness. Numa (Enzo Vogrincic) is our guide. He narrates. Giving us some inner insight, seeing how his team mates are reacting, the ones with hope, the ones already without, but to be honest this is such a stark story, it's impossible not to be pulled in by every deepening twist. They try to organise. Care for the wounded. Respect the dead. Conserve food. Wait for rescue. For all the horror, it's beautifully shot. The widescreen ratio accentuating the snowy mountain vista. Airplanes tease them in the distance, mere dots in the sky as the engine noise cascades around the mountain peaks. They're inventive it must be said. Nothing wasted, stripping what's left of the plane to make things as comfortable as possible. It is not comfortable. How long can you go without food? How long can you survive. If you don't know this story then I won't spoil it, but they go to some extremes, wrestle with moral questions than test their faith and humanity. It digs deeper than Alive. That film is not an easy watch, but the depths here are cavernous as fractions appear and splits occur. Marcelo (Diego Vegezzi) retains hope, talks of its importance as they others lose it. His faith part of his identity, but can that alone sustain you in such conditions. Adolfo (Esteban Kukuriczka) and Roberto (Matías Recalt) are more willing to embrace practical horrors. You can feel the cold. Sense the anguish. With each ray of hope extinguished, they hit new lows. It's utterly brutal. Yet this is not a woe is me story of defeat. Quite the opposite. It's the story of people who refuse to give up. Go to unfathomable lengths to keep going. You'll watch most of this with your teeth clenched. It doesn't deviate from the Alive timeline, why would it, but with a longer duration, uses the opportunity to flesh things out, so to speak. Both are great films, this one though, I think is amazing. It feels more rounded, more personal. Helped by the incredible end scenes that will have you smiling through the tears.","6 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Even better than Alive.","garethcrook","I am 61 years old and I remember well the events told in ""La sociedad de la nieve"". The film does not hide or underestimate what 50 years ago shocked the whole world, but - as the title suggests - it frames it in a broader context: what eventually humanity is. We are not the strongest race, nor the fastest, nor - for some time now - the most intelligent on our planet. But, as a group, we are incredibly resilient. Man is weak, but humanity is impossible to defeat. A message of great hope at a time when we are facing terrible challenges ahead of us. Not to be missed.Amazing soundtrack by Michail Giacchino. After having watched the movie, listen to ""Found"" which beautifully captures the message of the whole movie with minimal use of instruments and notes.","21 December 2023","8/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","After the Andes","pauedi1998","I know there have been many versions of the story told in this movie, but I haven't read or seen any of them, so this was all fresh to me.This is not a movie I think I would ever want to watch again. The word ""grueling"" was pretty much invented to describe the experience of watching this film. But damn is this riveting, even if in a kind of morbid way. It's also a dazzling technical achievement, one of those films where the effects are so seamless you can't always tell what's special effects and what's real.""Society of the Snow"" is not primarily a character-driven film, yet I was impressed by how much I came to know and like all of the characters in this despite the fact that only two or three are given the majority of screen time. At first, I didn't even know who was who and only knew they had names because their character's name would be listed before their line of dialogue in the subtitles. But by the time the film was over I felt like a knew all of them and cared about them deeply.This movie does a great job of showing the capacity humans have for normalizing behavior that in other circumstances would be unthinkable.One of my favorite movies of the year.Grade: A.","29 December 2023","10/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","A Message of Hope in a Time of Crisis","sntvcn","Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity.Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo...This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it.BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. Completely right!With films like THE PLATFORM, BELOW ZERO and most recently NOWHERE, the global streaming service NETFLIX has proven that it has an excellent hand for Spanish-language cinema. THE SOCIETY OF THE SNOW will most certainly continue this success story.","16 January 2024","8/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Stunning Technical Achievement","evanston_dad","I first read 'Alive' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I've read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of 'Alive' isn't about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there's that word again: IMAGINE) what it must've been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I'm starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I'm trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That's key here. How do you imagine that? You can't really, if you didn't experience it.Imagine...
In 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven't seen it, don't bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn't capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of 'Alive.' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn't sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn't change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular 'famous rock' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...
You cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn't go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won't let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...
And then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film 'Society of the Snow' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I've now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won't find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...
And of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the '93 film you would know that didn't look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn't win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn't ""I'm Ethan Hawke and I won't grow a beard"" bs. These actors literally look like they've been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that's why we're at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I've been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn't a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary ""The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn't believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did."" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn't need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I'm glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I've waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don't leave this film without it having an impact on you. It's not fiction.","4 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Spanish Disaster Movie by Juan Antonio BAYONA","ZeddaZogenau","One of the finest movies I have ever seen.This movie is very restricted by definition. This number of people are in this location--an extremely restricted location, and not much varies for the entire length of the (long) movie. It could have been very repetitious. It could have gotten boring. It could have resorted to being gory and sensationalistic. There's no romance, no car chases or explosions, no comedy. So, everything rests on the power of the script, and the acting, and the cinematography. And those all came through!! The script did this real life event justice in exactly the way previous scripts did not! It was nuanced. It was poignant. The acting was superb. The characters well drawn. Powerful little moments, short moving speeches, moral dilemmas, existential questions, solidarity, tiny seconds of joy in the face of adversity. These actors starved themselves to play the roles realistically. You can't help but ask yourself repeatedly ""What would I do?"" in this situation and that....
I'm a big fan of Ernest Shackleton and the amazing story of his Endurance expedition. Many parts of this film paralleled that story (and if you enjoy this film and watching how people survive in extremely challenging circumstances then I recommend reading Shackleton's Way). In fact, I wish this director would create a great version of that Endurance story-- because no one else has captured it well. You get a feeling for the power of leadership (not just by one ""leader"" but by anyone who chooses to step up and influence the group in a positive way that leads to desirable outcomes). I was engaged the entire time. Hats Off! I hope it wins lots of recognition and awards.","6 January 2024","8/10"

"Society of the Snow (2023)","Superb acting, excellent script","KHamblin-1","This is an astounding piece of work, in that it deals with a subject that seems almost impossible to re-create: the crash of the plane in the Andes mountains in October, 1972, carrying a male football team from Uruguay. The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.As a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.What seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.Everything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break. But if that's done in order to emphasize the frustration felt by the team players, it succeeds tremendously.","6 January 2024","10/10"

To heighten the reality of the movie, the crew and actors really put in all the effort, and I can even see that. Location filming, set design, and weight loss take a big part in transporting the audience back to that winter in 1972 and to the deep pile of snow somewhere in the Andes. Enzo Vogrincic's performance is applaudable. He describes the events from a step behind from the crowd, but he is still a part of the team. He maintains that balance perfectly. He does not seem too detached but still sees everything from above.","6 January 2024","10/10"

Giving us some inner insight, seeing how his team mates are reacting, the ones with hope, the ones already without, but to be honest this is such a stark story, it's impossible not to be pulled in by every deepening twist. They try to organise. Care for the wounded. Respect the dead. Conserve food. Wait for rescue. For all the horror, it's beautifully shot. The widescreen ratio accentuating the snowy mountain vista. Airplanes tease them in the distance, mere dots in the sky as the engine noise cascades around the mountain peaks. They're inventive it must be said. Nothing wasted, stripping what's left of the plane to make things as comfortable as possible. It is not comfortable. How long can you go without food? How long can you survive. If you don't know this story then I won't spoil it, but they go to some extremes, wrestle with moral questions than test their faith and humanity. It digs deeper than Alive. That film is not an easy watch, but the depths here are cavernous as fractions appear and splits occur. Marcelo (Diego Vegezzi) retains hope, talks of its importance as they others lose it. His faith part of his identity, but can that alone sustain you in such conditions. Adolfo (Esteban Kukuriczka) and Roberto (Matías Recalt) are more willing to embrace practical horrors. You can feel the cold. Sense the anguish. With each ray of hope extinguished, they hit new lows. It's utterly brutal. Yet this is not a woe is me story of defeat. Quite the opposite. It's the story of people who refuse to give up. Go to unfathomable lengths to keep going. You'll watch most of this with your teeth clenched. It doesn't deviate from the Alive timeline, why would it, but with a longer duration, uses the opportunity to flesh things out, so to speak. Both are great films, this one though, I think is amazing. It feels more rounded, more personal. Helped by the incredible end scenes that will have you smiling through the tears.","6 January 2024","9/10"

"Society of the Snow (2023)","A Message of Hope in a Time of Crisis","sntvcn","Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity.Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo...This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it.BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.

"Society of the Snow (2023)","Stunning Technical Achievement","evanston_dad","I first read 'Alive' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I've read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of 'Alive' isn't about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there's that word again: IMAGINE) what it must've been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I'm starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I'm trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That's key here. How do you imagine that? You can't really, if you didn't experience it.Imagine...
In 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven't seen it, don't bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn't capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of 'Alive.' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn't sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn't change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular 'famous rock' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...
You cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn't go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won't let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...
And then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film 'Society of the Snow' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I've now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won't find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...
And of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the '93 film you would know that didn't look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn't win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn't ""I'm Ethan Hawke and I won't grow a beard"" bs. These actors literally look like they've been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that's why we're at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I've been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn't a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary ""The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn't believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did."" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn't need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I'm glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I've waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don't leave this film without it having an impact on you. It's not fiction.","4 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Spanish Disaster Movie by Juan Antonio BAYONA","ZeddaZogenau","One of the finest movies I have ever seen.This movie is very restricted by definition. This number of people are in this location--an extremely restricted location, and not much varies for the entire length of the (long) movie. It could have been very repetitious. It could have gotten boring. It could have resorted to being gory and sensationalistic. There's no romance, no car chases or explosions, no comedy. So, everything rests on the power of the script, and the acting, and the cinematography. And those all came through!! The script did this real life event justice in exactly the way previous scripts did not! It was nuanced. It was poignant. The acting was superb. The characters well drawn. Powerful little moments, short moving speeches, moral dilemmas, existential questions, solidarity, tiny seconds of joy in the face of adversity. These actors starved themselves to play the roles realistically. You can't help but ask yourself repeatedly ""What would I do?"" in this situation and that....
I'm a big fan of Ernest Shackleton and the amazing story of his Endurance expedition. Many parts of this film paralleled that story (and if you enjoy this film and watching how people survive in extremely challenging circumstances then I recommend reading Shackleton's Way). In fact, I wish this director would create a great version of that Endurance story-- because no one else has captured it well. You get a feeling for the power of leadership (not just by one ""leader"" but by anyone who chooses to step up and influence the group in a positive way that leads to desirable outcomes). I was engaged the entire time. Hats Off! I hope it wins lots of recognition and awards.","6 January 2024","8/10"

"Society of the Snow (2023)","Superb acting, excellent script","KHamblin-1","This is an astounding piece of work, in that it deals with a subject that seems almost impossible to re-create: the crash of the plane in the Andes mountains in October, 1972, carrying a male football team from Uruguay. The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.As a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.What seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.Everything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break. But if that's done in order to emphasize the frustration felt by the team players, it succeeds tremendously.","6 January 2024","10/10"

To heighten the reality of the movie, the crew and actors really put in all the effort, and I can even see that. Location filming, set design, and weight loss take a big part in transporting the audience back to that winter in 1972 and to the deep pile of snow somewhere in the Andes. Enzo Vogrincic's performance is applaudable. He describes the events from a step behind from the crowd, but he is still a part of the team. He maintains that balance perfectly. He does not seem too detached but still sees everything from above.","6 January 2024","10/10"

I must admit I was staggered by just how good this film was. Upsetting, thought provoking, at times hard to watch, but one I couldn't turn away from.It is very sensitively handled, the story is told in a very human way, they don't focus on the bleaker side of the story too much, so we're not forced to watch the more unsavoury parts, instead they focus more on the human spirit, the fight for survival.I was worried that it would feel over long at 2.5 hours, but at no point did it dip, it went by very quickly.It's very nicely produced, it looks so good, my advice, watch in its original form, with the subtitles, it's so much better.Impressive.9/10.","7 January 2024","9/10"

Alive. It's very good. Do we need another film telling the story? Well for starters this is all in Spanish, which makes it feel more authentic and there's more build up and back story. We get to know the players a little bit more, but still it doesn't wait too long to board the plane. They're off to play a match in Santiago. Taking off from Uruguay, the weather is good, the colours are vibrant. It looks beautiful. Everyone's happy. Excited. Smiling. Adventure awaits. Just not the one expected. They're kids on a plane. Jovial, having fun, until they're not. Do not watch this if you're due to fly soon. It is absolutely terrifying. The crash sequence is viseral. Chaotic. Flesh and metal twisted together. Blood. Bone. Panic. It's honestly a blessing to be killed rather than survive. Some do though of course and set out on an unimaginable hell.

It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...
And then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film 'Society of the Snow' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I've now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won't find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...
And of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the '93 film you would know that didn't look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn't win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn't ""I'm Ethan Hawke and I won't grow a beard"" bs. These actors literally look like they've been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that's why we're at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I've been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn't a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary ""The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn't believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did."" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn't need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I'm glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I've waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don't leave this film without it having an impact on you. It's not fiction.","4 January 2024","9/10"

This number of people are in this location--an extremely restricted location, and not much varies for the entire length of the (long) movie. It could have been very repetitious. It could have gotten boring. It could have resorted to being gory and sensationalistic. There's no romance, no car chases or explosions, no comedy. So, everything rests on the power of the script, and the acting, and the cinematography. And those all came through!! The script did this real life event justice in exactly the way previous scripts did not! It was nuanced. It was poignant. The acting was superb. The characters well drawn. Powerful little moments, short moving speeches, moral dilemmas, existential questions, solidarity, tiny seconds of joy in the face of adversity. These actors starved themselves to play the roles realistically. You can't help but ask yourself repeatedly ""What would I do?"" in this situation and that....
I'm a big fan of Ernest Shackleton and the amazing story of his Endurance expedition. Many parts of this film paralleled that story (and if you enjoy this film and watching how people survive in extremely challenging circumstances then I recommend reading Shackleton's Way). In fact, I wish this director would create a great version of that Endurance story-- because no one else has captured it well.

"Society of the Snow (2023)","Superb acting, excellent script","KHamblin-1","This is an astounding piece of work, in that it deals with a subject that seems almost impossible to re-create: the crash of the plane in the Andes mountains in October, 1972, carrying a male football team from Uruguay. The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.As a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.What seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.Everything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break. But if that's done in order to emphasize the frustration felt by the team players, it succeeds tremendously.","6 January 2024","10/10"

I must admit I was staggered by just how good this film was. Upsetting, thought provoking, at times hard to watch, but one I couldn't turn away from.It is very sensitively handled, the story is told in a very human way, they don't focus on the bleaker side of the story too much, so we're not forced to watch the more unsavoury parts, instead they focus more on the human spirit, the fight for survival.I was worried that it would feel over long at 2.5 hours, but at no point did it dip, it went by very quickly.It's very nicely produced, it looks so good, my advice, watch in its original form, with the subtitles, it's so much better.Impressive.9/10.","7 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Netflix strikes a hit with this enthralling true life drama","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","There's a film about the Uruguayan rugby team crash landing in the Andes in the 70s. Alive. It's very good. Do we need another film telling the story? Well for starters this is all in Spanish, which makes it feel more authentic and there's more build up and back story. We get to know the players a little bit more, but still it doesn't wait too long to board the plane. They're off to play a match in Santiago. Taking off from Uruguay, the weather is good, the colours are vibrant. It looks beautiful. Everyone's happy. Excited. Smiling. Adventure awaits. Just not the one expected. They're kids on a plane. Jovial, having fun, until they're not. Do not watch this if you're due to fly soon. It is absolutely terrifying. The crash sequence is viseral. Chaotic. Flesh and metal twisted together. Blood. Bone. Panic. It's honestly a blessing to be killed rather than survive. Some do though of course and set out on an unimaginable hell. The night hits, the temperatures drop, how on earth do you comprehend the pain and anguish they endure. We can't of course, but Society of the Snow does help to give us a sense, at least visually even if we can't truly understand the hellish madness. Numa (Enzo Vogrincic) is our guide. He narrates. Giving us some inner insight, seeing how his team mates are reacting, the ones with hope, the ones already without, but to be honest this is such a stark story, it's impossible not to be pulled in by every deepening twist. They try to organise. Care for the wounded. Respect the dead. Conserve food. Wait for rescue. For all the horror, it's beautifully shot. The widescreen ratio accentuating the snowy mountain vista. Airplanes tease them in the distance, mere dots in the sky as the engine noise cascades around the mountain peaks. They're inventive it must be said. Nothing wasted, stripping what's left of the plane to make things as comfortable as possible. It is not comfortable. How long can you go without food? How long can you survive. If you don't know this story then I won't spoil it, but they go to some extremes, wrestle with moral questions than test their faith and humanity. It digs deeper than Alive. That film is not an easy watch, but the depths here are cavernous as fractions appear and splits occur. Marcelo (Diego Vegezzi) retains hope, talks of its importance as they others lose it. His faith part of his identity, but can that alone sustain you in such conditions. Adolfo (Esteban Kukuriczka) and Roberto (Matías Recalt) are more willing to embrace practical horrors. You can feel the cold. Sense the anguish. With each ray of hope extinguished, they hit new lows. It's utterly brutal. Yet this is not a woe is me story of defeat. Quite the opposite. It's the story of people who refuse to give up. Go to unfathomable lengths to keep going. You'll watch most of this with your teeth clenched. It doesn't deviate from the Alive timeline, why would it, but with a longer duration, uses the opportunity to flesh things out, so to speak. Both are great films, this one though, I think is amazing. It feels more rounded, more personal. Helped by the incredible end scenes that will have you smiling through the tears.","6 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Even better than Alive.","garethcrook","I am 61 years old and I remember well the events told in ""La sociedad de la nieve"". The film does not hide or underestimate what 50 years ago shocked the whole world, but - as the title suggests - it frames it in a broader context: what eventually humanity is. We are not the strongest race, nor the fastest, nor - for some time now - the most intelligent on our planet. But, as a group, we are incredibly resilient. Man is weak, but humanity is impossible to defeat. A message of great hope at a time when we are facing terrible challenges ahead of us. Not to be missed.Amazing soundtrack by Michail Giacchino.

The word ""grueling"" was pretty much invented to describe the experience of watching this film. But damn is this riveting, even if in a kind of morbid way. It's also a dazzling technical achievement, one of those films where the effects are so seamless you can't always tell what's special effects and what's real.""Society of the Snow"" is not primarily a character-driven film, yet I was impressed by how much I came to know and like all of the characters in this despite the fact that only two or three are given the majority of screen time. At first, I didn't even know who was who and only knew they had names because their character's name would be listed before their line of dialogue in the subtitles. But by the time the film was over I felt like a knew all of them and cared about them deeply.This movie does a great job of showing the capacity humans have for normalizing behavior that in other circumstances would be unthinkable.One of my favorite movies of the year.Grade: A.","29 December 2023","10/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","A Message of Hope in a Time of Crisis","sntvcn","Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity.Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo...This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it.BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. Completely right!With films like THE PLATFORM, BELOW ZERO and most recently NOWHERE, the global streaming service NETFLIX has proven that it has an excellent hand for Spanish-language cinema. THE SOCIETY OF THE SNOW will most certainly continue this success story.","16 January 2024","8/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Stunning Technical Achievement","evanston_dad","I first read 'Alive' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I've read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of 'Alive' isn't about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there's that word again: IMAGINE) what it must've been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I'm starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I'm trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That's key here. How do you imagine that? You can't really, if you didn't experience it.Imagine...
In 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven't seen it, don't bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn't capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of 'Alive.' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn't sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn't change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular 'famous rock' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...
You cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn't go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won't let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...

Upsetting, thought provoking, at times hard to watch, but one I couldn't turn away from.It is very sensitively handled, the story is told in a very human way, they don't focus on the bleaker side of the story too much, so we're not forced to watch the more unsavoury parts, instead they focus more on the human spirit, the fight for survival.I was worried that it would feel over long at 2.5 hours, but at no point did it dip, it went by very quickly.It's very nicely produced, it looks so good, my advice, watch in its original form, with the subtitles, it's so much better.Impressive.9/10.","7 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Netflix strikes a hit with this enthralling true life drama","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","There's a film about the Uruguayan rugby team crash landing in the Andes in the 70s. Alive. It's very good. Do we need another film telling the story? Well for starters this is all in Spanish, which makes it feel more authentic and there's more build up and back story. We get to know the players a little bit more, but still it doesn't wait too long to board the plane. They're off to play a match in Santiago. Taking off from Uruguay, the weather is good, the colours are vibrant. It looks beautiful. Everyone's happy. Excited. Smiling. Adventure awaits. Just not the one expected. They're kids on a plane. Jovial, having fun, until they're not. Do not watch this if you're due to fly soon. It is absolutely terrifying. The crash sequence is viseral. Chaotic. Flesh and metal twisted together. Blood. Bone. Panic. It's honestly a blessing to be killed rather than survive. Some do though of course and set out on an unimaginable hell. The night hits, the temperatures drop, how on earth do you comprehend the pain and anguish they endure. We can't of course, but Society of the Snow does help to give us a sense, at least visually even if we can't truly understand the hellish madness. Numa (Enzo Vogrincic) is our guide. He narrates. Giving us some inner insight, seeing how his team mates are reacting, the ones with hope, the ones already without, but to be honest this is such a stark story, it's impossible not to be pulled in by every deepening twist. They try to organise. Care for the wounded. Respect the dead. Conserve food. Wait for rescue. For all the horror, it's beautifully shot. The widescreen ratio accentuating the snowy mountain vista. Airplanes tease them in the distance, mere dots in the sky as the engine noise cascades around the mountain peaks. They're inventive it must be said. Nothing wasted, stripping what's left of the plane to make things as comfortable as possible. It is not comfortable. How long can you go without food? How long can you survive. If you don't know this story then I won't spoil it, but they go to some extremes, wrestle with moral questions than test their faith and humanity. It digs deeper than Alive. That film is not an easy watch, but the depths here are cavernous as fractions appear and splits occur. Marcelo (Diego Vegezzi) retains hope, talks of its importance as they others lose it. His faith part of his identity, but can that alone sustain you in such conditions. Adolfo (Esteban Kukuriczka) and Roberto (Matías Recalt) are more willing to embrace practical horrors. You can feel the cold. Sense the anguish. With each ray of hope extinguished, they hit new lows. It's utterly brutal. Yet this is not a woe is me story of defeat. Quite the opposite. It's the story of people who refuse to give up. Go to unfathomable lengths to keep going. You'll watch most of this with your teeth clenched. It doesn't deviate from the Alive timeline, why would it, but with a longer duration, uses the opportunity to flesh things out, so to speak. Both are great films, this one though, I think is amazing. It feels more rounded, more personal. Helped by the incredible end scenes that will have you smiling through the tears.","6 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Even better than Alive.","garethcrook","I am 61 years old and I remember well the events told in ""La sociedad de la nieve"". The film does not hide or underestimate what 50 years ago shocked the whole world, but - as the title suggests - it frames it in a broader context: what eventually humanity is. We are not the strongest race, nor the fastest, nor - for some time now - the most intelligent on our planet. But, as a group, we are incredibly resilient. Man is weak, but humanity is impossible to defeat. A message of great hope at a time when we are facing terrible challenges ahead of us. Not to be missed.Amazing soundtrack by Michail Giacchino.

The word ""grueling"" was pretty much invented to describe the experience of watching this film. But damn is this riveting, even if in a kind of morbid way. It's also a dazzling technical achievement, one of those films where the effects are so seamless you can't always tell what's special effects and what's real.""Society of the Snow"" is not primarily a character-driven film, yet I was impressed by how much I came to know and like all of the characters in this despite the fact that only two or three are given the majority of screen time. At first, I didn't even know who was who and only knew they had names because their character's name would be listed before their line of dialogue in the subtitles. But by the time the film was over I felt like a knew all of them and cared about them deeply.This movie does a great job of showing the capacity humans have for normalizing behavior that in other circumstances would be unthinkable.One of my favorite movies of the year.Grade: A.","29 December 2023","10/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","A Message of Hope in a Time of Crisis","sntvcn","Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity.Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo...This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it.BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. Completely right!With films like THE PLATFORM, BELOW ZERO and most recently NOWHERE, the global streaming service NETFLIX has proven that it has an excellent hand for Spanish-language cinema. THE SOCIETY OF THE SNOW will most certainly continue this success story.","16 January 2024","8/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Stunning Technical Achievement","evanston_dad","I first read 'Alive' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I've read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of 'Alive' isn't about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there's that word again: IMAGINE) what it must've been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I'm starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I'm trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That's key here. How do you imagine that? You can't really, if you didn't experience it.Imagine...
In 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven't seen it, don't bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn't capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of 'Alive.' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn't sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn't change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular 'famous rock' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...
You cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn't go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won't let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...
And then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film 'Society of the Snow' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I've now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won't find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...
And of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the '93 film you would know that didn't look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn't win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn't ""I'm Ethan Hawke and I won't grow a beard"" bs. These actors literally look like they've been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that's why we're at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I've been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn't a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary ""The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn't believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did."" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn't need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I'm glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I've waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don't leave this film without it having an impact on you. It's not fiction.","4 January 2024","9/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Spanish Disaster Movie by Juan Antonio BAYONA","ZeddaZogenau","One of the finest movies I have ever seen.This movie is very restricted by definition. This number of people are in this location--an extremely restricted location, and not much varies for the entire length of the (long) movie. It could have been very repetitious. It could have gotten boring. It could have resorted to being gory and sensationalistic. There's no romance, no car chases or explosions, no comedy. So, everything rests on the power of the script, and the acting, and the cinematography. And those all came through!! The script did this real life event justice in exactly the way previous scripts did not! It was nuanced. It was poignant. The acting was superb. The characters well drawn. Powerful little moments, short moving speeches, moral dilemmas, existential questions, solidarity, tiny seconds of joy in the face of adversity. These actors starved themselves to play the roles realistically. You can't help but ask yourself repeatedly ""What would I do?"" in this situation and that....
I'm a big fan of Ernest Shackleton and the amazing story of his Endurance expedition. Many parts of this film paralleled that story (and if you enjoy this film and watching how people survive in extremely challenging circumstances then I recommend reading Shackleton's Way). In fact, I wish this director would create a great version of that Endurance story-- because no one else has captured it well. You get a feeling for the power of leadership (not just by one ""leader"" but by anyone who chooses to step up and influence the group in a positive way that leads to desirable outcomes). I was engaged the entire time. Hats Off! I hope it wins lots of recognition and awards.","6 January 2024","8/10"

"Society of the Snow (2023)","Superb acting, excellent script","KHamblin-1","This is an astounding piece of work, in that it deals with a subject that seems almost impossible to re-create: the crash of the plane in the Andes mountains in October, 1972, carrying a male football team from Uruguay. The young men who are cast in the roles of the surviving members are all amazing actors, and hold their characters in ways that are beyond imagining, as they would have to maintain the same character throughout the time that they had to film in the confines of the wreckage.As a minor critique, I had a hard time distinguishing between the team members themselves, and lost track early on of which one was telling the story -- apparently I somehow could not associate the voiceover with the particular actor, and so I got slightly confused after trying to keep track of which cast member was the main protagonist.What seems to be most astounding is how many of them were able to survive in the harshest of all climates, and to maintain their mental state in a situation that seems hopeless to say the least. This is a brilliant re-creation of the event and the outcome is equally astounding.Everything about this film says that it is an Oscar-worthy project, and certainly deserves to win, with only one minor exception (as evidenced by my 9 instead of 10): the film is slightly too padded, and by removing something like 20 or 30 minutes (at least), the project would then become perfect. I know that the Director has his own viewpoint, but he should sympathize with those of us who are confined to squirming around in our seats after the first 90 or so minutes, and need to get out of the torture of watching such an ordeal without a break. But if that's done in order to emphasize the frustration felt by the team players, it succeeds tremendously.","6 January 2024","10/10"
"Society of the Snow (2023)","Emotional, masterful","martinpersson97","Comparison between extreme wide shots of beautiful and even magical nature and close-up of faces of agony and shots of cramped space of broken aircraft creates a bizarre sense of incompatibility. To heighten the reality of the movie, the crew and actors really put in all the effort, and I can even see that. Location filming, set design, and weight loss take a big part in transporting the audience back to that winter in 1972 and to the deep pile of snow somewhere in the Andes. Enzo Vogrincic's performance is applaudable. He describes the events from a step behind from the crowd, but he is still a part of the team. He maintains that balance perfectly. He does not seem too detached but still sees everything from above.","6 January 2024","10/10"
"The Iron Claw (2023)","""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?""","classicsoncall","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10"
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy.

And their images were then plastered on paper in magazines that covered the racks at the local drug store or grocery store.And it was every bit as influential as anything that one could possibly find on their phones today.This is an unbelievable and incredible tale.Everyone should know the Von Erichs.They will after seeing this.","24 December 2023","6/10"

They also have very good chemistry on screen.Story wise it is a very good story, but very sad at the same time. It does have the benefit of being based off of a truly amazing story of a family of athletes. The dialogue is very well written. The story goes very smoothly.The production value was good.

Aside from that, I went into this movie completely blind; I'm not a wrestling fan and I didn't research anything about the Von Erichs before seeing this.This film is so tragic that I found myself astounded by the fact that it was based on a true story. It feels like something out of a Greek tragedy or Stephen King novel. Unfortunately, it's neither: this is the story of an obsessive and unfeeling man who forced his failed dreams onto each of his sons ... and the catastrophes it caused...
Everyone who talks about ""The Iron Claw"" is going to rave about how great of a job Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White are in this (and don't get me wrong, they're PHENOMENAL), but I was especially blown away by Harris Dickinson's portrayal of David Von Erich; he carried every scene he was in with a larger-than-life, yet supportive persona.""The Iron Claw"" is more than good enough to earn a couple of Oscar nominations next year ... but based on the recently released shortlist and strong competition, I doubt it's going to make it.Regardless, I still recommend this unbelievable and emotional movie.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","To me, this was good, but not great.","Jeremy_Urquhart","For 2023 it's nice to see a film in theater that is high caliber. The Iron Claw hits on many different levels and tells a story with conviction and care.The acting was convincing and the size of Zac Efron is flat out impressive (regardless if supplements were involved). In terms of drama, Efron is subtle mostly, but really shines in the final scene of the movie.The pace is just about perfect. There is no meandering or long drawn out sequences that make you want to check the time. There are a few jumps in years but you don't get confused how much time has passed, keeping the audience engaged and not figuring out timelines.The movie is based on a true story and has a lot of tragic moments, but there is also hope which helps balance the tone. The Iron Claw is a good movie and I'm sure will be up for an Oscar or two.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","Solid 10","austinbeyondcompare","Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't. His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.","22 December 2023","10/10"

The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?""","classicsoncall","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10"
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?""","classicsoncall","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10"
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me.

Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","Solid 10","austinbeyondcompare","Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't.

President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well.

"Past Lives (2023)","Like a Stephen Sondheim Song Come to Life","evanston_dad","And first-time director Celine Song has created one of these. It's a masterpiece of deeply genuine human emotion. And that masterpiece is Past Lives.Song's dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters' true psychology.A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it's all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.This very well may be the best film of 2023. It's the work of a master storyteller, and it's only her first film.","19 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Beautiful, touching film","gbill-74877","Past Lives is a beautifully understated and emotionally resonant film about the power of love, loss, and second chances. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), two childhood friends who are reunited 20 years after they were separated by Nora's family's emigration from South Korea. The film explores the complex emotions that arise when these two old friends reconnect, as they grapple with the choices they've made in their lives and the possibility of what might have been.Song's direction is assured and sensitive, and she elicits outstanding performances from her two leads. Lee and Yoo are both incredibly charismatic and believable as Nora and Hae Sung, and their chemistry is undeniable.The film's cinematography is gorgeous, with Shabier Kirchner's lens capturing the beauty of both Seoul and New York City. The film's score is also superb, with a haunting and evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's emotional tone.Past Lives is a beautifully made and deeply moving film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It's a film about love, loss, and the power of second chances, and it's sure to resonate with anyone who has ever experienced the pain of separation or the joy of reunion.Rating: 4 out of 5 starsSome of the things that I particularly liked about the film include:The film's understated and realistic depiction of love and relationships.The film's sensitive and nuanced portrayal of the Asian American experience.The film's beautiful cinematography and evocative score.The film's two lead performances, which are both incredibly charismatic and believable.Overall, I thought Past Lives was a beautiful and moving film that is sure to stay with me long after I've seen it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thoughtful and emotionally resonant film to watch.","12 September 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Painfully good","Jeremy_Urquhart","The wind, the leaves, the streets, the towers; everything exists with a supple glow. There's a love for environment behind the camera, where director Celine Song stands, telling her story. Kirchner, her cinematographer, lends immense craft to the film's 35mm scenery. Nora, Hae Sung, Arthur; the three central characters are handled with wonderful grace. They easily communicate complex emotion. They're likable, and they're relatable. New York City, Seoul; I hardly know either of them practically, but now I feel like I do, in some intimate way. These two cities are dearly loved. Longing; what did you think of when you finished this film?Past Lives is an honest, delicate, and ambling movie. Nora, once a little girl from urban Korea, chooses her path as an American writer after immigrating with her family. She marries a different writer (Arthur, a Jewish New Yorker), adopts the culture of NYC, and chases her ambition. She's still Korean, but the identity ebbs. She doesn't sound like it anymore. Hae Sung, her childhood friend who never left the country, is very much Korean; his path is that of an engineer living with his parents, which he describes as ordinary. He loves Nora deeply. He loved her when she left Seoul at twelve, and loved her still at the points in which their lives intersected. Nora loves him too, in her own complicated, almost grieving way. He is her connection to a childhood she longs for, washed away in her memories, and seldom revisited because of the complicated feelings that come with being a child immigrant.The story is simple but it bursts at the seams with emotion and humor. Admittedly slow, but without wasting your time. I connected with all three of the main characters to some degree, each carried by an actor with the apparent gravity of a veteran superstar. They are emotionally intelligent, and they react to each other in interesting, startlingly realistic ways. Celine Song plays on a very specific feeling of aching; for a forgotten time in one's life, for an identity, or for a lover. It's particular, but looking around the audience as we left the theater, you could see that most people were in their own heads, thinking of something (or someone). We all long for something lost.Perhaps not all of us, but probably most, have also wrestled with the feeling of permanence in the journey we choose for ourselves. You only live once, said Drake, but that's really a terrifying thought sometimes. Carving out one lifetime - engineered across thousands of individual decisions - means foregoing an infinite number of others. People deal with this in a number of ways; providence, reincarnation, and an afterlife, to name a few. Nora and Hae Sung might be soulmates, but will they know it in this lifetime, or the next?I really can't wait for the next project Song works on, and that goes double for the cast. I sunk my teeth into this deeply romantic, deeply resonant film, which is capable of bringing immense longing to the surface. It is coated with a beautiful score and draped atop memorable settings. It's a home-run.9/10 for making me want to visit Seoul.","23 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Sometimes simple stories are the best.","benjaminskylerhill","Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.","15 July 2023","10/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Someone who leaves","dannylee-78082","I saw the trailer to ""Past Lives"" before a showing of ""Master Gardener,"" and immediately knew I wanted to see it. I have an affinity for Asian cinema, but more than that, the concept of past lovers reconnecting after decades made for an intriguing premise, one that I had to see unfold on the big screen. And after seeing it unfold (on the big screen), I honestly can't tell how I feel about ""Past Lives,"" which, I guess, means it left me feeling kind of cold.With so many people gushing over this movie, the fact that I fail to see what others are seeing has made me somewhat uncomfortable. I'd have loved to witness the ""pitch-perfect romance"" that critics say ""Past Lives"" contains. I wish I managed to see the ""first great film of the year""; instead, I watched a perfectly watchable film, but one that didn't leave much of an imprint on me. ""Past Lives"" is less a romance and more a dramatic exploration of what could have been. And while that seems like it could be interesting, the unlikeable character of Nora, played by Greta Lee, and the distinctly unromantic and uncomfortable story progression made for a decidedly cringy experience. So, let's start with Nora.Greta Lee is a great actress - there is no doubt about that. The thing is that her character, Nora, is extremely unlikable and unsympathetic. Throughout the course of the entire film she makes mean, borderline cruel choices that put others through the emotional ringer. This left me entirely unsympathetic to her romantic plight - however, I did enjoy Teo Yoo's portrayal as Hae Sung, and especially John Magaro's character of Arthur; both of them play entirely believable and relatable characters who become caught up in situations either of their own doing or of someone else's.As I mentioned, ""Past Lives"" is also remarkably unromantic. Instead of seeing two people fall in love against all odds, you'll witness a bizarre sort of reconnection with a third-wheel that is obviously against everything that's occurring. It's not romantic - purposefully so, I think - but it's also not very fun to watch, which might be the point, but still. The whole ""will they, won't they"" scenario begins to fall short as you'll begin to realize that you don't care whether they will or they won't because of how awkward the entire scenario is. And with an ending that feels more of a fizzle than a bang, when the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel empty. ""That's life,"" the movie seems to say, hoping you simply accept what it's showing you.The more I think about this film, the less I like it, which sucks because I really wanted to like it. Call me a romantic, but I was hoping for a more straightforward love story, and what I got was something that was awkward, uncomfortable, and un-enjoyable.","17 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Closure In Love","statuskuo","Having played at the Sundance and Berlin Film Festivals this year to rave reviews, A24's ""Past Lives"" is every bit as extraordinary as many are claiming it is. I've always liked many A24 films, so after the film's sterling critical acclaim, I was very interested in seeing it. There's no doubt that this film is just about as supremely impactful and thoughtful a directorial debut, that analyzes and meditates on universal themes through the lens of unique subtexts and incisive, superbly written character development. The film's title derives from the South Korean concept of ""In Yun,"" which means that the experiences with other people that we meet and spend time with in life today are derived or based on equivalences from past lives. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee,) a writer originally from South Korea who had immigrated first to Toronto and then to New York City. She's married to Arthur (john Magaro,) but has also been connecting over FaceTime with her childhood friend Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim.) He has recently finished his mandatory military service in Korea, and hasn't seen Nora in over a decade.While some of the basic themes that Celine Song's screenplay touches on may seem clichéd, viewers should know that their treatment in the story and relative to the powerful character development is completely original and creative. There is a deep emotional impact on the viewer as the most basic themes of the story (love, interpersonal connection, friendship, immigration, cultural identity) affect the three main characters each in different and wholly authentic ways. The screenplay is superbly written, establishing dramatic tension in an interpersonal way while thoughtfully taking its time to further develop the storytelling. At a relatively short 106 minutes, the film is perfectly paced, never seeming too fast or too slow to allow the viewers to appropriately interpret the characters and their unique qualities and place within the story. Being able to provide such a powerful performance to complement this material is no easy feat, but all three main actors (Lee, Min Yim, and Magaro) do so with flying colors. Their emotions and chemistry are completely genuine from the first frame until the credits roll. While the film's stakes may seem relatively low (and, to some extent, they can be,) Song's formal, technical, and artistic control of the medium is no less extraordinary. The film is beautifully shot and scored, presenting an understated, airy, and gentle vibe that complements but never overbears the outstanding acting and writing on display. It's lyrical, enthralling, and fully liberated from derivativeness or tedium. Even simple location shots, such as a carousel near a waterfront, help complement the emotional connection between the characters in such shots in a soulful and deliberate way.In short, ""Past Lives"" provides a well-made and well-acted reflection on how love, longing, and culture make us learn and grow over time so powerful and rooted in original and creative storytelling. As a result, in my opinion, it is the best film released since Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" in 2019. Bravo! 10/10.","25 June 2023","8/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","beautiful and moving","TheBigSick","My expectations were quite high for this drama, because of its award nominations and wins, I wasn't disappointed. Celine Song wrote and directed a truly terrific drama, a film worthy to be called cinema, in her feature directorial debut as well. Her work and cooperation with Shabier Kirchner (cinematographer) is terrific, together bringing some truly mesmerizing shots, much to thank for the sets used and mise-en-scene, also natural lighting. The plot is semi-autobiographical and inspired by real events from Song's life, which enhances and makes it so much more authentic and believable. The characters feel so real, their lives feel so real, and so does the film. The writing and direction is absolutely perfect, Celine Song created a masterpiece with Past Lives.Nora and Hae Sung, two deeply connected childhood friends, are wrested apart after Nora's family emigrates from South Korea. Twenty years later, they are reunited for one fateful week as they confront notions of love and destiny.Around the ten minute mark, there's a scene when the children (Na Young, later Nora Moon and Hae Sung) are walking different ways, the scenes are shot and set up like Nora is walking towards a bright future as she's walking upwards whilst Hae is walking straight and then downwards. The scene symbolizes the different paths they're about to make in life, thus setting up the story and plot for the film. Having the film go through the events at a rapid pace could have been executed poorly but Celine Song executed it perfectly as she quickly established the characters and plot without it feeling poorly done, excellent work! Then twelve years swiftly goes past and the film truly begins. Celine Song focuses a lot on the aesthetics and mise-en-scene, making each shot perfectly photographed and set up brilliantly which enhances the visual storytelling. Like for example in a Skype call, we get an understanding of what Nora is studying or is interested in before she tells Hae and it's thanks to the visual storytelling and placement of props and the overall production design.Past Lives was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and received various awards including five nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, those being; Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Picture - Non-English Language, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama. With nominations like that, I'm sure this film will bring something for everyone. If not for the brilliant acting from everyone but mostly Greta Lee as Nora Moon and Teo Yoo as Hae Sung, the former being absolutely fantastic and worthy of her nomination. But also of the terrific writing, emotional depth and realism that make you feel lost in the story from minutes into it.Manola Darghis writing for The New York Times compared the film to French romantic cinema complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes stating: ""The movie's modesty - its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph - is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette's 1974 classic Céline and Julie Go Boating in Nora's father's home office in Seoul."" This film critic compliments the film rightfully, bringing up solid arguments why it's so great. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan also praised the film and named it one of his favorites, describing it as ""subtle in a beautiful sort of way."" I agree fully with these people, Past Lives is one of the best films of 2023, a film I'll remember and hopefully go back to in the future. Creatively and cinematically on another level than what many films that year were making. My expectations were met in this incredible romantic-drama.Update: So I rewatched it with my girlfriend and she shared my opinion in how great it was, this time I got the opportunity to view the film without criticism or analyzing in thoughts, which made me catch onto some dialogue I failed to notice and some other minor things, one thing I noticed was how slow the pacing was which was something I didn't notice before. Yet, I still liked it and it was nice to experience the film that way, just be along for the ride and see the plot play out.","7 July 2023","9/10"

Two young teens in South Korea are best friends who intimate taking their relationship to the next level (the girl's mom lets them go out on an official date) but the looming move (mom & daughter are moving to Canada) seems to be the stop sign for any forward movement. 12 years pass & the girl now woman, played by the luminous Greta Lee, remarks to her mother about seeing a social media post from her old beau, now played by Teo Yoo, & decides to make contact via vid chat to catch up. They soon reminisce about the time they spent apart & the choices they've made w/the coda being would Young, about to embark into military service w/hopes of being a Mandarin language translator, be willing to give up everything to reconnect w/Lee. He says no & then we flash forward another 12 years where Lee is living in New York w/her husband, John Magaro (they met at an artist commune), on the heels of a visit from Yoo who is soon expected so when he finally arrives both almost lovers reunite in the flesh leading to a meeting of 2 souls that should've been together forever but time & space deemed opposite.

"Past Lives (2023)","All The Dudes Cried","dnkqbzw","I felt that the director spent too much energy establishing the distance in time and location, that she didn't develop the characters enough to make you feel empathy for any of them.Sure many of us have had that childhood crush that we wish could be revisited in later years, or at least some curiosity of what happened in the meantime. But it feels like those gaps in time weren't filled with anything. It's as if the characters had stopped for 12 years, then started again, then stopped, then started again, which would not be realistic.I was also half expecting Nora to talk about 9/11 as they were on the boat, and how it affected her, as she would have been living in NYC at that time, but that wasn't even brought up. Not that it was crucial to the plot of the film, but it did shape a lot of people's lives who lived through it.What really got under my skin, though, was the long pauses. I get it, you want to convey emotion through watching the characters pausing and looking at each other without saying anything. But after the 3rd or 4th time, it just felt really forced.Ultimately, I didn't really feel any emotion for any of the characters, and what good is a drama if you aren't connecting with the people in it? Worth a look, but in the end, you don't really feel you learned anything at the end.","28 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Like a Stephen Sondheim Song Come to Life","evanston_dad","And first-time director Celine Song has created one of these. It's a masterpiece of deeply genuine human emotion. And that masterpiece is Past Lives.Song's dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters' true psychology.A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it's all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.This very well may be the best film of 2023.

"Past Lives (2023)","Painfully good","Jeremy_Urquhart","The wind, the leaves, the streets, the towers; everything exists with a supple glow. There's a love for environment behind the camera, where director Celine Song stands, telling her story. Kirchner, her cinematographer, lends immense craft to the film's 35mm scenery. Nora, Hae Sung, Arthur; the three central characters are handled with wonderful grace. They easily communicate complex emotion. They're likable, and they're relatable. New York City, Seoul; I hardly know either of them practically, but now I feel like I do, in some intimate way. These two cities are dearly loved. Longing; what did you think of when you finished this film?Past Lives is an honest, delicate, and ambling movie. Nora, once a little girl from urban Korea, chooses her path as an American writer after immigrating with her family. She marries a different writer (Arthur, a Jewish New Yorker), adopts the culture of NYC, and chases her ambition. She's still Korean, but the identity ebbs. She doesn't sound like it anymore. Hae Sung, her childhood friend who never left the country, is very much Korean; his path is that of an engineer living with his parents, which he describes as ordinary. He loves Nora deeply. He loved her when she left Seoul at twelve, and loved her still at the points in which their lives intersected. Nora loves him too, in her own complicated, almost grieving way. He is her connection to a childhood she longs for, washed away in her memories, and seldom revisited because of the complicated feelings that come with being a child immigrant.The story is simple but it bursts at the seams with emotion and humor. Admittedly slow, but without wasting your time. I connected with all three of the main characters to some degree, each carried by an actor with the apparent gravity of a veteran superstar. They are emotionally intelligent, and they react to each other in interesting, startlingly realistic ways. Celine Song plays on a very specific feeling of aching; for a forgotten time in one's life, for an identity, or for a lover. It's particular, but looking around the audience as we left the theater, you could see that most people were in their own heads, thinking of something (or someone). We all long for something lost.Perhaps not all of us, but probably most, have also wrestled with the feeling of permanence in the journey we choose for ourselves. You only live once, said Drake, but that's really a terrifying thought sometimes. Carving out one lifetime - engineered across thousands of individual decisions - means foregoing an infinite number of others. People deal with this in a number of ways; providence, reincarnation, and an afterlife, to name a few. Nora and Hae Sung might be soulmates, but will they know it in this lifetime, or the next?I really can't wait for the next project Song works on, and that goes double for the cast. I sunk my teeth into this deeply romantic, deeply resonant film, which is capable of bringing immense longing to the surface. It is coated with a beautiful score and draped atop memorable settings. It's a home-run.9/10 for making me want to visit Seoul.","23 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Sometimes simple stories are the best.","benjaminskylerhill","Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.","15 July 2023","10/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Someone who leaves","dannylee-78082","I saw the trailer to ""Past Lives"" before a showing of ""Master Gardener,"" and immediately knew I wanted to see it. I have an affinity for Asian cinema, but more than that, the concept of past lovers reconnecting after decades made for an intriguing premise, one that I had to see unfold on the big screen. And after seeing it unfold (on the big screen), I honestly can't tell how I feel about ""Past Lives,"" which, I guess, means it left me feeling kind of cold.With so many people gushing over this movie, the fact that I fail to see what others are seeing has made me somewhat uncomfortable. I'd have loved to witness the ""pitch-perfect romance"" that critics say ""Past Lives"" contains. I wish I managed to see the ""first great film of the year""; instead, I watched a perfectly watchable film, but one that didn't leave much of an imprint on me. ""Past Lives"" is less a romance and more a dramatic exploration of what could have been. And while that seems like it could be interesting, the unlikeable character of Nora, played by Greta Lee, and the distinctly unromantic and uncomfortable story progression made for a decidedly cringy experience. So, let's start with Nora.Greta Lee is a great actress - there is no doubt about that. The thing is that her character, Nora, is extremely unlikable and unsympathetic. Throughout the course of the entire film she makes mean, borderline cruel choices that put others through the emotional ringer. This left me entirely unsympathetic to her romantic plight - however, I did enjoy Teo Yoo's portrayal as Hae Sung, and especially John Magaro's character of Arthur; both of them play entirely believable and relatable characters who become caught up in situations either of their own doing or of someone else's.As I mentioned, ""Past Lives"" is also remarkably unromantic. Instead of seeing two people fall in love against all odds, you'll witness a bizarre sort of reconnection with a third-wheel that is obviously against everything that's occurring. It's not romantic - purposefully so, I think - but it's also not very fun to watch, which might be the point, but still. The whole ""will they, won't they"" scenario begins to fall short as you'll begin to realize that you don't care whether they will or they won't because of how awkward the entire scenario is. And with an ending that feels more of a fizzle than a bang, when the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel empty. ""That's life,"" the movie seems to say, hoping you simply accept what it's showing you.The more I think about this film, the less I like it, which sucks because I really wanted to like it. Call me a romantic, but I was hoping for a more straightforward love story, and what I got was something that was awkward, uncomfortable, and un-enjoyable.","17 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Closure In Love","statuskuo","Having played at the Sundance and Berlin Film Festivals this year to rave reviews, A24's ""Past Lives"" is every bit as extraordinary as many are claiming it is. I've always liked many A24 films, so after the film's sterling critical acclaim, I was very interested in seeing it. There's no doubt that this film is just about as supremely impactful and thoughtful a directorial debut, that analyzes and meditates on universal themes through the lens of unique subtexts and incisive, superbly written character development. The film's title derives from the South Korean concept of ""In Yun,"" which means that the experiences with other people that we meet and spend time with in life today are derived or based on equivalences from past lives. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee,) a writer originally from South Korea who had immigrated first to Toronto and then to New York City. She's married to Arthur (john Magaro,) but has also been connecting over FaceTime with her childhood friend Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim.) He has recently finished his mandatory military service in Korea, and hasn't seen Nora in over a decade.While some of the basic themes that Celine Song's screenplay touches on may seem clichéd, viewers should know that their treatment in the story and relative to the powerful character development is completely original and creative. There is a deep emotional impact on the viewer as the most basic themes of the story (love, interpersonal connection, friendship, immigration, cultural identity) affect the three main characters each in different and wholly authentic ways. The screenplay is superbly written, establishing dramatic tension in an interpersonal way while thoughtfully taking its time to further develop the storytelling. At a relatively short 106 minutes, the film is perfectly paced, never seeming too fast or too slow to allow the viewers to appropriately interpret the characters and their unique qualities and place within the story. Being able to provide such a powerful performance to complement this material is no easy feat, but all three main actors (Lee, Min Yim, and Magaro) do so with flying colors. Their emotions and chemistry are completely genuine from the first frame until the credits roll. While the film's stakes may seem relatively low (and, to some extent, they can be,) Song's formal, technical, and artistic control of the medium is no less extraordinary. The film is beautifully shot and scored, presenting an understated, airy, and gentle vibe that complements but never overbears the outstanding acting and writing on display. It's lyrical, enthralling, and fully liberated from derivativeness or tedium. Even simple location shots, such as a carousel near a waterfront, help complement the emotional connection between the characters in such shots in a soulful and deliberate way.In short, ""Past Lives"" provides a well-made and well-acted reflection on how love, longing, and culture make us learn and grow over time so powerful and rooted in original and creative storytelling. As a result, in my opinion, it is the best film released since Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" in 2019. Bravo! 10/10.","25 June 2023","8/10"

It's particular, but looking around the audience as we left the theater, you could see that most people were in their own heads, thinking of something (or someone). We all long for something lost.Perhaps not all of us, but probably most, have also wrestled with the feeling of permanence in the journey we choose for ourselves. You only live once, said Drake, but that's really a terrifying thought sometimes. Carving out one lifetime - engineered across thousands of individual decisions - means foregoing an infinite number of others. People deal with this in a number of ways; providence, reincarnation, and an afterlife, to name a few. Nora and Hae Sung might be soulmates, but will they know it in this lifetime, or the next?I really can't wait for the next project Song works on, and that goes double for the cast. I sunk my teeth into this deeply romantic, deeply resonant film, which is capable of bringing immense longing to the surface. It is coated with a beautiful score and draped atop memorable settings. It's a home-run.9/10 for making me want to visit Seoul.","23 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Sometimes simple stories are the best.","benjaminskylerhill","Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.","15 July 2023","10/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Someone who leaves","dannylee-78082","I saw the trailer to ""Past Lives"" before a showing of ""Master Gardener,"" and immediately knew I wanted to see it. I have an affinity for Asian cinema, but more than that, the concept of past lovers reconnecting after decades made for an intriguing premise, one that I had to see unfold on the big screen. And after seeing it unfold (on the big screen), I honestly can't tell how I feel about ""Past Lives,"" which, I guess, means it left me feeling kind of cold.With so many people gushing over this movie, the fact that I fail to see what others are seeing has made me somewhat uncomfortable. I'd have loved to witness the ""pitch-perfect romance"" that critics say ""Past Lives"" contains. I wish I managed to see the ""first great film of the year""; instead, I watched a perfectly watchable film, but one that didn't leave much of an imprint on me. ""Past Lives"" is less a romance and more a dramatic exploration of what could have been. And while that seems like it could be interesting, the unlikeable character of Nora, played by Greta Lee, and the distinctly unromantic and uncomfortable story progression made for a decidedly cringy experience. So, let's start with Nora.Greta Lee is a great actress - there is no doubt about that. The thing is that her character, Nora, is extremely unlikable and unsympathetic. Throughout the course of the entire film she makes mean, borderline cruel choices that put others through the emotional ringer. This left me entirely unsympathetic to her romantic plight - however, I did enjoy Teo Yoo's portrayal as Hae Sung, and especially John Magaro's character of Arthur; both of them play entirely believable and relatable characters who become caught up in situations either of their own doing or of someone else's.As I mentioned, ""Past Lives"" is also remarkably unromantic. Instead of seeing two people fall in love against all odds, you'll witness a bizarre sort of reconnection with a third-wheel that is obviously against everything that's occurring. It's not romantic - purposefully so, I think - but it's also not very fun to watch, which might be the point, but still. The whole ""will they, won't they"" scenario begins to fall short as you'll begin to realize that you don't care whether they will or they won't because of how awkward the entire scenario is. And with an ending that feels more of a fizzle than a bang, when the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel empty. ""That's life,"" the movie seems to say, hoping you simply accept what it's showing you.The more I think about this film, the less I like it, which sucks because I really wanted to like it. Call me a romantic, but I was hoping for a more straightforward love story, and what I got was something that was awkward, uncomfortable, and un-enjoyable.","17 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Closure In Love","statuskuo","Having played at the Sundance and Berlin Film Festivals this year to rave reviews, A24's ""Past Lives"" is every bit as extraordinary as many are claiming it is. I've always liked many A24 films, so after the film's sterling critical acclaim, I was very interested in seeing it. There's no doubt that this film is just about as supremely impactful and thoughtful a directorial debut, that analyzes and meditates on universal themes through the lens of unique subtexts and incisive, superbly written character development. The film's title derives from the South Korean concept of ""In Yun,"" which means that the experiences with other people that we meet and spend time with in life today are derived or based on equivalences from past lives. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee,) a writer originally from South Korea who had immigrated first to Toronto and then to New York City. She's married to Arthur (john Magaro,) but has also been connecting over FaceTime with her childhood friend Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim.) He has recently finished his mandatory military service in Korea, and hasn't seen Nora in over a decade.While some of the basic themes that Celine Song's screenplay touches on may seem clichéd, viewers should know that their treatment in the story and relative to the powerful character development is completely original and creative. There is a deep emotional impact on the viewer as the most basic themes of the story (love, interpersonal connection, friendship, immigration, cultural identity) affect the three main characters each in different and wholly authentic ways. The screenplay is superbly written, establishing dramatic tension in an interpersonal way while thoughtfully taking its time to further develop the storytelling. At a relatively short 106 minutes, the film is perfectly paced, never seeming too fast or too slow to allow the viewers to appropriately interpret the characters and their unique qualities and place within the story. Being able to provide such a powerful performance to complement this material is no easy feat, but all three main actors (Lee, Min Yim, and Magaro) do so with flying colors. Their emotions and chemistry are completely genuine from the first frame until the credits roll. While the film's stakes may seem relatively low (and, to some extent, they can be,) Song's formal, technical, and artistic control of the medium is no less extraordinary. The film is beautifully shot and scored, presenting an understated, airy, and gentle vibe that complements but never overbears the outstanding acting and writing on display. It's lyrical, enthralling, and fully liberated from derivativeness or tedium. Even simple location shots, such as a carousel near a waterfront, help complement the emotional connection between the characters in such shots in a soulful and deliberate way.In short, ""Past Lives"" provides a well-made and well-acted reflection on how love, longing, and culture make us learn and grow over time so powerful and rooted in original and creative storytelling. As a result, in my opinion, it is the best film released since Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" in 2019. Bravo! 10/10.","25 June 2023","8/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","beautiful and moving","TheBigSick","My expectations were quite high for this drama, because of its award nominations and wins, I wasn't disappointed. Celine Song wrote and directed a truly terrific drama, a film worthy to be called cinema, in her feature directorial debut as well. Her work and cooperation with Shabier Kirchner (cinematographer) is terrific, together bringing some truly mesmerizing shots, much to thank for the sets used and mise-en-scene, also natural lighting. The plot is semi-autobiographical and inspired by real events from Song's life, which enhances and makes it so much more authentic and believable. The characters feel so real, their lives feel so real, and so does the film. The writing and direction is absolutely perfect, Celine Song created a masterpiece with Past Lives.Nora and Hae Sung, two deeply connected childhood friends, are wrested apart after Nora's family emigrates from South Korea. Twenty years later, they are reunited for one fateful week as they confront notions of love and destiny.Around the ten minute mark, there's a scene when the children (Na Young, later Nora Moon and Hae Sung) are walking different ways, the scenes are shot and set up like Nora is walking towards a bright future as she's walking upwards whilst Hae is walking straight and then downwards. The scene symbolizes the different paths they're about to make in life, thus setting up the story and plot for the film. Having the film go through the events at a rapid pace could have been executed poorly but Celine Song executed it perfectly as she quickly established the characters and plot without it feeling poorly done, excellent work! Then twelve years swiftly goes past and the film truly begins. Celine Song focuses a lot on the aesthetics and mise-en-scene, making each shot perfectly photographed and set up brilliantly which enhances the visual storytelling. Like for example in a Skype call, we get an understanding of what Nora is studying or is interested in before she tells Hae and it's thanks to the visual storytelling and placement of props and the overall production design.Past Lives was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and received various awards including five nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, those being; Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Picture - Non-English Language, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama. With nominations like that, I'm sure this film will bring something for everyone. If not for the brilliant acting from everyone but mostly Greta Lee as Nora Moon and Teo Yoo as Hae Sung, the former being absolutely fantastic and worthy of her nomination. But also of the terrific writing, emotional depth and realism that make you feel lost in the story from minutes into it.Manola Darghis writing for The New York Times compared the film to French romantic cinema complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes stating: ""The movie's modesty - its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph - is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette's 1974 classic Céline and Julie Go Boating in Nora's father's home office in Seoul."" This film critic compliments the film rightfully, bringing up solid arguments why it's so great. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan also praised the film and named it one of his favorites, describing it as ""subtle in a beautiful sort of way."" I agree fully with these people, Past Lives is one of the best films of 2023, a film I'll remember and hopefully go back to in the future. Creatively and cinematically on another level than what many films that year were making. My expectations were met in this incredible romantic-drama.Update: So I rewatched it with my girlfriend and she shared my opinion in how great it was, this time I got the opportunity to view the film without criticism or analyzing in thoughts, which made me catch onto some dialogue I failed to notice and some other minor things, one thing I noticed was how slow the pacing was which was something I didn't notice before. Yet, I still liked it and it was nice to experience the film that way, just be along for the ride and see the plot play out.","7 July 2023","9/10"

"Past Lives (2023)","What I learned from it","elisavbizau","Currently nominated for Best Picture (& also for Best Original Screenplay for Celine Song) comes this film about the ultimate romantic 'what if'. Two young teens in South Korea are best friends who intimate taking their relationship to the next level (the girl's mom lets them go out on an official date) but the looming move (mom & daughter are moving to Canada) seems to be the stop sign for any forward movement. 12 years pass & the girl now woman, played by the luminous Greta Lee, remarks to her mother about seeing a social media post from her old beau, now played by Teo Yoo, & decides to make contact via vid chat to catch up. They soon reminisce about the time they spent apart & the choices they've made w/the coda being would Young, about to embark into military service w/hopes of being a Mandarin language translator, be willing to give up everything to reconnect w/Lee. He says no & then we flash forward another 12 years where Lee is living in New York w/her husband, John Magaro (they met at an artist commune), on the heels of a visit from Yoo who is soon expected so when he finally arrives both almost lovers reunite in the flesh leading to a meeting of 2 souls that should've been together forever but time & space deemed opposite. Song's yarn, inspired by circumstances in her own life, lets the uncomfortable silences become comforting w/the performances on par for the best of the year (poor Greta was robbed frankly) w/a narrative so in tune as poetic treatise (something Barry Jenkins did w/his Moonlight) about the road not travelled.","26 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","All The Dudes Cried","dnkqbzw","I felt that the director spent too much energy establishing the distance in time and location, that she didn't develop the characters enough to make you feel empathy for any of them.Sure many of us have had that childhood crush that we wish could be revisited in later years, or at least some curiosity of what happened in the meantime. But it feels like those gaps in time weren't filled with anything. It's as if the characters had stopped for 12 years, then started again, then stopped, then started again, which would not be realistic.I was also half expecting Nora to talk about 9/11 as they were on the boat, and how it affected her, as she would have been living in NYC at that time, but that wasn't even brought up. Not that it was crucial to the plot of the film, but it did shape a lot of people's lives who lived through it.What really got under my skin, though, was the long pauses. I get it, you want to convey emotion through watching the characters pausing and looking at each other without saying anything. But after the 3rd or 4th time, it just felt really forced.Ultimately, I didn't really feel any emotion for any of the characters, and what good is a drama if you aren't connecting with the people in it? Worth a look, but in the end, you don't really feel you learned anything at the end.","28 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Like a Stephen Sondheim Song Come to Life","evanston_dad","And first-time director Celine Song has created one of these. It's a masterpiece of deeply genuine human emotion. And that masterpiece is Past Lives.Song's dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters' true psychology.A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it's all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.This very well may be the best film of 2023. It's the work of a master storyteller, and it's only her first film.","19 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Beautiful, touching film","gbill-74877","Past Lives is a beautifully understated and emotionally resonant film about the power of love, loss, and second chances. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), two childhood friends who are reunited 20 years after they were separated by Nora's family's emigration from South Korea. The film explores the complex emotions that arise when these two old friends reconnect, as they grapple with the choices they've made in their lives and the possibility of what might have been.Song's direction is assured and sensitive, and she elicits outstanding performances from her two leads. Lee and Yoo are both incredibly charismatic and believable as Nora and Hae Sung, and their chemistry is undeniable.The film's cinematography is gorgeous, with Shabier Kirchner's lens capturing the beauty of both Seoul and New York City. The film's score is also superb, with a haunting and evocative soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's emotional tone.Past Lives is a beautifully made and deeply moving film that will stay with you long after you've seen it.

"Past Lives (2023)","Painfully good","Jeremy_Urquhart","The wind, the leaves, the streets, the towers; everything exists with a supple glow. There's a love for environment behind the camera, where director Celine Song stands, telling her story. Kirchner, her cinematographer, lends immense craft to the film's 35mm scenery. Nora, Hae Sung, Arthur; the three central characters are handled with wonderful grace. They easily communicate complex emotion. They're likable, and they're relatable. New York City, Seoul; I hardly know either of them practically, but now I feel like I do, in some intimate way. These two cities are dearly loved. Longing; what did you think of when you finished this film?Past Lives is an honest, delicate, and ambling movie. Nora, once a little girl from urban Korea, chooses her path as an American writer after immigrating with her family. She marries a different writer (Arthur, a Jewish New Yorker), adopts the culture of NYC, and chases her ambition. She's still Korean, but the identity ebbs. She doesn't sound like it anymore. Hae Sung, her childhood friend who never left the country, is very much Korean; his path is that of an engineer living with his parents, which he describes as ordinary. He loves Nora deeply. He loved her when she left Seoul at twelve, and loved her still at the points in which their lives intersected. Nora loves him too, in her own complicated, almost grieving way. He is her connection to a childhood she longs for, washed away in her memories, and seldom revisited because of the complicated feelings that come with being a child immigrant.The story is simple but it bursts at the seams with emotion and humor. Admittedly slow, but without wasting your time. I connected with all three of the main characters to some degree, each carried by an actor with the apparent gravity of a veteran superstar. They are emotionally intelligent, and they react to each other in interesting, startlingly realistic ways. Celine Song plays on a very specific feeling of aching; for a forgotten time in one's life, for an identity, or for a lover.

Two young teens in South Korea are best friends who intimate taking their relationship to the next level (the girl's mom lets them go out on an official date) but the looming move (mom & daughter are moving to Canada) seems to be the stop sign for any forward movement. 12 years pass & the girl now woman, played by the luminous Greta Lee, remarks to her mother about seeing a social media post from her old beau, now played by Teo Yoo, & decides to make contact via vid chat to catch up. They soon reminisce about the time they spent apart & the choices they've made w/the coda being would Young, about to embark into military service w/hopes of being a Mandarin language translator, be willing to give up everything to reconnect w/Lee. He says no & then we flash forward another 12 years where Lee is living in New York w/her husband, John Magaro (they met at an artist commune), on the heels of a visit from Yoo who is soon expected so when he finally arrives both almost lovers reunite in the flesh leading to a meeting of 2 souls that should've been together forever but time & space deemed opposite.

"Past Lives (2023)","All The Dudes Cried","dnkqbzw","I felt that the director spent too much energy establishing the distance in time and location, that she didn't develop the characters enough to make you feel empathy for any of them.Sure many of us have had that childhood crush that we wish could be revisited in later years, or at least some curiosity of what happened in the meantime. But it feels like those gaps in time weren't filled with anything. It's as if the characters had stopped for 12 years, then started again, then stopped, then started again, which would not be realistic.I was also half expecting Nora to talk about 9/11 as they were on the boat, and how it affected her, as she would have been living in NYC at that time, but that wasn't even brought up. Not that it was crucial to the plot of the film, but it did shape a lot of people's lives who lived through it.What really got under my skin, though, was the long pauses. I get it, you want to convey emotion through watching the characters pausing and looking at each other without saying anything. But after the 3rd or 4th time, it just felt really forced.Ultimately, I didn't really feel any emotion for any of the characters, and what good is a drama if you aren't connecting with the people in it? Worth a look, but in the end, you don't really feel you learned anything at the end.","28 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Like a Stephen Sondheim Song Come to Life","evanston_dad","And first-time director Celine Song has created one of these. It's a masterpiece of deeply genuine human emotion. And that masterpiece is Past Lives.Song's dialogue is understated to the point of risking not creating a connection with the characters. It would not have worked with sub-par actors. But the risk payed off big time-all of these actors are wonderful, allowing their body language and line delivery fill in the gaps with their characters' true psychology.A simple plot becomes a richly complex story of lost love, sought closure, and found purpose; and it's all due to Celine Song having the proper understanding of when to allow silence to speak.Yet despite the frequent bouts of silence, not a moment feels wasted. Every shot and sentence is meticulously edited to give us exactly what we need to feel each moment with its full emotional power.This very well may be the best film of 2023. It's the work of a master storyteller, and it's only her first film.","19 June 2023","9/10"

"Past Lives (2023)","Painfully good","Jeremy_Urquhart","The wind, the leaves, the streets, the towers; everything exists with a supple glow. There's a love for environment behind the camera, where director Celine Song stands, telling her story. Kirchner, her cinematographer, lends immense craft to the film's 35mm scenery. Nora, Hae Sung, Arthur; the three central characters are handled with wonderful grace. They easily communicate complex emotion. They're likable, and they're relatable. New York City, Seoul; I hardly know either of them practically, but now I feel like I do, in some intimate way. These two cities are dearly loved. Longing; what did you think of when you finished this film?Past Lives is an honest, delicate, and ambling movie. Nora, once a little girl from urban Korea, chooses her path as an American writer after immigrating with her family. She marries a different writer (Arthur, a Jewish New Yorker), adopts the culture of NYC, and chases her ambition. She's still Korean, but the identity ebbs. She doesn't sound like it anymore. Hae Sung, her childhood friend who never left the country, is very much Korean; his path is that of an engineer living with his parents, which he describes as ordinary. He loves Nora deeply. He loved her when she left Seoul at twelve, and loved her still at the points in which their lives intersected. Nora loves him too, in her own complicated, almost grieving way. He is her connection to a childhood she longs for, washed away in her memories, and seldom revisited because of the complicated feelings that come with being a child immigrant.The story is simple but it bursts at the seams with emotion and humor. Admittedly slow, but without wasting your time. I connected with all three of the main characters to some degree, each carried by an actor with the apparent gravity of a veteran superstar. They are emotionally intelligent, and they react to each other in interesting, startlingly realistic ways. Celine Song plays on a very specific feeling of aching; for a forgotten time in one's life, for an identity, or for a lover. It's particular, but looking around the audience as we left the theater, you could see that most people were in their own heads, thinking of something (or someone). We all long for something lost.Perhaps not all of us, but probably most, have also wrestled with the feeling of permanence in the journey we choose for ourselves. You only live once, said Drake, but that's really a terrifying thought sometimes. Carving out one lifetime - engineered across thousands of individual decisions - means foregoing an infinite number of others. People deal with this in a number of ways; providence, reincarnation, and an afterlife, to name a few. Nora and Hae Sung might be soulmates, but will they know it in this lifetime, or the next?I really can't wait for the next project Song works on, and that goes double for the cast. I sunk my teeth into this deeply romantic, deeply resonant film, which is capable of bringing immense longing to the surface. It is coated with a beautiful score and draped atop memorable settings. It's a home-run.9/10 for making me want to visit Seoul.","23 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Sometimes simple stories are the best.","benjaminskylerhill","Such a beautiful picture film. It has everything you want from a good movie: a cute romance, philosophy to guide the narrative, characters that feel real even if you don't get to see what they do (in his case) or barely see anything (in her case). It's as if the scriptwriters managed to weave a touching romance out of snippets, without it feeling like you're watching something unfinished.There's this one scene where they show how time passes. I loved the cinematography behind that. Simple yet rewarding visually.From this movie I learned that you should accept love and realise that you don't have to give up what you have for what you could have. You can accept both those feelings of love inside of you and even if it hurts, it's what I believe makes the soul feel alive.","15 July 2023","10/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Someone who leaves","dannylee-78082","I saw the trailer to ""Past Lives"" before a showing of ""Master Gardener,"" and immediately knew I wanted to see it. I have an affinity for Asian cinema, but more than that, the concept of past lovers reconnecting after decades made for an intriguing premise, one that I had to see unfold on the big screen. And after seeing it unfold (on the big screen), I honestly can't tell how I feel about ""Past Lives,"" which, I guess, means it left me feeling kind of cold.With so many people gushing over this movie, the fact that I fail to see what others are seeing has made me somewhat uncomfortable. I'd have loved to witness the ""pitch-perfect romance"" that critics say ""Past Lives"" contains. I wish I managed to see the ""first great film of the year""; instead, I watched a perfectly watchable film, but one that didn't leave much of an imprint on me. ""Past Lives"" is less a romance and more a dramatic exploration of what could have been. And while that seems like it could be interesting, the unlikeable character of Nora, played by Greta Lee, and the distinctly unromantic and uncomfortable story progression made for a decidedly cringy experience. So, let's start with Nora.Greta Lee is a great actress - there is no doubt about that. The thing is that her character, Nora, is extremely unlikable and unsympathetic. Throughout the course of the entire film she makes mean, borderline cruel choices that put others through the emotional ringer. This left me entirely unsympathetic to her romantic plight - however, I did enjoy Teo Yoo's portrayal as Hae Sung, and especially John Magaro's character of Arthur; both of them play entirely believable and relatable characters who become caught up in situations either of their own doing or of someone else's.As I mentioned, ""Past Lives"" is also remarkably unromantic. Instead of seeing two people fall in love against all odds, you'll witness a bizarre sort of reconnection with a third-wheel that is obviously against everything that's occurring. It's not romantic - purposefully so, I think - but it's also not very fun to watch, which might be the point, but still. The whole ""will they, won't they"" scenario begins to fall short as you'll begin to realize that you don't care whether they will or they won't because of how awkward the entire scenario is. And with an ending that feels more of a fizzle than a bang, when the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel empty. ""That's life,"" the movie seems to say, hoping you simply accept what it's showing you.The more I think about this film, the less I like it, which sucks because I really wanted to like it. Call me a romantic, but I was hoping for a more straightforward love story, and what I got was something that was awkward, uncomfortable, and un-enjoyable.","17 June 2023","9/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","Closure In Love","statuskuo","Having played at the Sundance and Berlin Film Festivals this year to rave reviews, A24's ""Past Lives"" is every bit as extraordinary as many are claiming it is. I've always liked many A24 films, so after the film's sterling critical acclaim, I was very interested in seeing it. There's no doubt that this film is just about as supremely impactful and thoughtful a directorial debut, that analyzes and meditates on universal themes through the lens of unique subtexts and incisive, superbly written character development. The film's title derives from the South Korean concept of ""In Yun,"" which means that the experiences with other people that we meet and spend time with in life today are derived or based on equivalences from past lives. The film follows Nora (Greta Lee,) a writer originally from South Korea who had immigrated first to Toronto and then to New York City. She's married to Arthur (john Magaro,) but has also been connecting over FaceTime with her childhood friend Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim.) He has recently finished his mandatory military service in Korea, and hasn't seen Nora in over a decade.While some of the basic themes that Celine Song's screenplay touches on may seem clichéd, viewers should know that their treatment in the story and relative to the powerful character development is completely original and creative. There is a deep emotional impact on the viewer as the most basic themes of the story (love, interpersonal connection, friendship, immigration, cultural identity) affect the three main characters each in different and wholly authentic ways. The screenplay is superbly written, establishing dramatic tension in an interpersonal way while thoughtfully taking its time to further develop the storytelling. At a relatively short 106 minutes, the film is perfectly paced, never seeming too fast or too slow to allow the viewers to appropriately interpret the characters and their unique qualities and place within the story. Being able to provide such a powerful performance to complement this material is no easy feat, but all three main actors (Lee, Min Yim, and Magaro) do so with flying colors. Their emotions and chemistry are completely genuine from the first frame until the credits roll. While the film's stakes may seem relatively low (and, to some extent, they can be,) Song's formal, technical, and artistic control of the medium is no less extraordinary. The film is beautifully shot and scored, presenting an understated, airy, and gentle vibe that complements but never overbears the outstanding acting and writing on display. It's lyrical, enthralling, and fully liberated from derivativeness or tedium. Even simple location shots, such as a carousel near a waterfront, help complement the emotional connection between the characters in such shots in a soulful and deliberate way.In short, ""Past Lives"" provides a well-made and well-acted reflection on how love, longing, and culture make us learn and grow over time so powerful and rooted in original and creative storytelling. As a result, in my opinion, it is the best film released since Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" in 2019. Bravo! 10/10.","25 June 2023","8/10"
"Past Lives (2023)","beautiful and moving","TheBigSick","My expectations were quite high for this drama, because of its award nominations and wins, I wasn't disappointed. Celine Song wrote and directed a truly terrific drama, a film worthy to be called cinema, in her feature directorial debut as well. Her work and cooperation with Shabier Kirchner (cinematographer) is terrific, together bringing some truly mesmerizing shots, much to thank for the sets used and mise-en-scene, also natural lighting. The plot is semi-autobiographical and inspired by real events from Song's life, which enhances and makes it so much more authentic and believable. The characters feel so real, their lives feel so real, and so does the film. The writing and direction is absolutely perfect, Celine Song created a masterpiece with Past Lives.Nora and Hae Sung, two deeply connected childhood friends, are wrested apart after Nora's family emigrates from South Korea. Twenty years later, they are reunited for one fateful week as they confront notions of love and destiny.Around the ten minute mark, there's a scene when the children (Na Young, later Nora Moon and Hae Sung) are walking different ways, the scenes are shot and set up like Nora is walking towards a bright future as she's walking upwards whilst Hae is walking straight and then downwards. The scene symbolizes the different paths they're about to make in life, thus setting up the story and plot for the film. Having the film go through the events at a rapid pace could have been executed poorly but Celine Song executed it perfectly as she quickly established the characters and plot without it feeling poorly done, excellent work! Then twelve years swiftly goes past and the film truly begins. Celine Song focuses a lot on the aesthetics and mise-en-scene, making each shot perfectly photographed and set up brilliantly which enhances the visual storytelling. Like for example in a Skype call, we get an understanding of what Nora is studying or is interested in before she tells Hae and it's thanks to the visual storytelling and placement of props and the overall production design.Past Lives was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and received various awards including five nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, those being; Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Picture - Non-English Language, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama. With nominations like that, I'm sure this film will bring something for everyone. If not for the brilliant acting from everyone but mostly Greta Lee as Nora Moon and Teo Yoo as Hae Sung, the former being absolutely fantastic and worthy of her nomination. But also of the terrific writing, emotional depth and realism that make you feel lost in the story from minutes into it.Manola Darghis writing for The New York Times compared the film to French romantic cinema complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes stating: ""The movie's modesty - its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph - is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette's 1974 classic Céline and Julie Go Boating in Nora's father's home office in Seoul."" This film critic compliments the film rightfully, bringing up solid arguments why it's so great. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan also praised the film and named it one of his favorites, describing it as ""subtle in a beautiful sort of way."" I agree fully with these people, Past Lives is one of the best films of 2023, a film I'll remember and hopefully go back to in the future. Creatively and cinematically on another level than what many films that year were making. My expectations were met in this incredible romantic-drama.Update: So I rewatched it with my girlfriend and she shared my opinion in how great it was, this time I got the opportunity to view the film without criticism or analyzing in thoughts, which made me catch onto some dialogue I failed to notice and some other minor things, one thing I noticed was how slow the pacing was which was something I didn't notice before. Yet, I still liked it and it was nice to experience the film that way, just be along for the ride and see the plot play out.","7 July 2023","9/10"

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. ""All of Us Strangers"" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It's one of the year's best, bar none.","24 February 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s. Rarely has the maligned pop music of this decade come into its own more than in this masterpiece.I will never forget this film.","29 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I have questions and concerns and yet it's the most moving movie I've seen in years.","tom-640","All of Us Strangers is filled with beautiful lines like that which is one of the main reasons it's such an emotional film. Exploring how moving on is such an important part of dealing with a traumatic experience, and often the hardest part. It's designed to warm the heart almost as many times as it'll break it.Andrew Scott portrays his character's sadness and quietness in such a natural fashion, making every emotional moment that much more impactful. Paul Mescal once again provides a charming exterior to hide his own pain and when he's with Scott their chemistry is ridiculously palpable.Claire Foy and Jamie Bell are pretty much perfect at portraying 1980s parents. Everything from what they say to the way they say it feels incredibly accurate and seeing them react to the revelations of how times have changed since then leads to some of the most emotional heart to hearts.Andrew Haigh's direction excels because of the tenderness. There's so much time put into showing the smaller yet vital parts of the growing connection between everyone and the lighting imbues everything with a stunning glow. The soundtrack is full of ideal choices but the final song is particularly devastating.","27 January 2024","9/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"

Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it?

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me?

But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it?

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10"

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","The film is a devastating look at one man's loneliness. Andrew Scott is giving a brilliant performance. With a simple facial expression, he can tell an entire story. He is one of the best actors around. (Scott, Mescal, Bale, Day Lewis -all great all non-American. Where are the great young American actors? But I digress..)
Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it. But I leave that for the viewer to determine. Do not miss!","29 October 2023","9/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","10/10"
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it? What did you think?","10 February 2024","8/10"

I had high hopes after seeing the critics reviews and it did not disappoint.The story follows Adam and his neighbour Harry, with whom he develops a romantic relationship with, as he deals with the grief from his parents tragic death when he was child.The film cuts across genres. At times it is funny, sad, romantic, and even horrifying. It is a damning depiction of the loneliness epidemic among younger men while also dealing with the added challenges faced by those within the lgbt community in trying to fit in.The chemistry between Scott and Mescal is brilliant, while Foy and Bell really hit the right note in their roles. The film is also beautifully shot and has a lovely palette of colours within.It's a tough watch and left me with a lump in my throat for the entire final third, but it thoroughly deserves all the praise it has received so far.9/10.","18 December 2023","5/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

You know... the kinds of movies where the writing is rarely the draw. Then I watch something with great writing and feel metaphorical whiplash. The difference is drastic.Witty dialogue, intriguing story and clever scenarios elevate everything. The cast all give fantastic performances, especially Jeffrey Wright. But for me personally, by far the best attribute is the comedy. I full-volume laughed throughout. And the humor feels entirely original.My only dislike is a few subplots, like the love life of his brother or the maid, that don't seem to be related to the main plot.

"American Fiction (2023)","""The dumber I behave, the richer I get!""","classicsoncall","""American Fiction"" has a great premise, one of the best in any movie this year. And I overall liked it and think it was well made, so I'm rounding my score up to reflect that. But it somehow didn't completely land for me, in a way that I find hard to explain.I think it was the domestic drama part of the film that didn't completely work for me. The movie spends a lot of time on all the ways that Jeffrey Wright feels overwhelmed by his life's responsibilities, and it sags in some of these parts, and makes the movie feel a little bit like a slog. And I don't know that I ever completely believed the character played by Sterling K. Brown, who never seemed convincing as a gay man. But I did like what the film had to say about the burden placed on black people to constantly be representing black people everywhere that white people never have to deal with. And I also liked the choose your own adventure ending that takes the film into meta territory in its final scenes.So, solid double for me, but not a home run.Grade: A-","13 January 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"

The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"

The film is a good mix of drama and comedy. One storyline makes fun of how, even though society is becoming more accepting of minorities, it unintentionally marginalizes them by continuing to perpetuate stereotypes. At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society. This is a great film to watch with friends and discuss afterward.","13 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags.

"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"

That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope.

"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years.

"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"

"American Fiction (2023)","American Fiction is a smart and well-crafted film, an absolute must-see","kevin_robbins","""American Fiction"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Cord Jefferson, based on the novel ""Erasure"" by Percival Everett. Starring Jeffrey Wright in the lead role, it stands as one of the best written, most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long time.In Los Angeles, literature professor Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues. Wishing to spend this time off with his family, Monk travels to Boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby. Monk's Q&A panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), whose novel ""We's Lives in Da Ghetto"" has become a number one bestseller. Surprised at how much Sintara's book panders to African American stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers, Monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style, titling it ""My Pafology"" and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer. Under the pen name ""Stagg R. Leigh"", Monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered $750,000 and a movie deal for the rights to his story.It can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others. All too often, many writers, artists, performers, and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times. Of course, this can yield mixed results, as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product, a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process. This is especially the case with the current political climate, with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race, sexuality, and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not. The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters. Coming from a man with such a highly educated background, it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for Monk to compromise what could have been a clever in-depth story about two black friends, but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering. To his surprise, Monk's experiment works a little too well, and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone. On that note, perhaps the best way to describe this film is that it's like a combination of Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" and Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"", as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonist.In addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story, the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments, primarily shown through members of Monk's immediate family. Although it is shown that Monk had a respectable upbringing, his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today. For instance, his mother Agnes (Leslie Uggams) suffers from early stages of Alzheimer's disease, causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives. Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk. Several times throughout the film, we witness Monk react to all of the bizarre, sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him, and Wright's facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes. In the previously mentioned opening, it's easy to understand how irritated Monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student, and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation. I've always found Wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years, so it's nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this film.Worth mentioning as well is Sterling K. Brown as Cliff, Monk's estranged homosexual younger brother. What I liked most about Cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to Monk of the importance of staying true to himself. In one scene, which I won't discuss in too much detail due to spoilers, we see Cliff and Monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself. This introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film, and Brown definitely holds his own alongside Wright during this particular moment. You are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground, despite all of their past disagreements.Taking into account its timely subject matter, Cord Jefferson's ""American Fiction"" stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest, funniest satirical films to be released in many years. It's so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come. Of course, Jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the film's cast, whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay. With all that said, Jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizon.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.","8 February 2024","8/10"

"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"

That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"

At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society.

The film ""American Fiction"" is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the world's view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescension.From the very opening scene, you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view. We watch as Monk, a well educated African American university scholar, has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class. The book in question, whose title contains a racial slur, offends the young student with hair dyed neon green, prompting her to question why he isn't offended along with her. Monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught, then she can as well, which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all. The scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students, especially from an African American perspective, is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does. This is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling, which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against it.Later on when Monk writes his book, we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique. Gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical African American street vernacular spoken by violent gun-wielding criminals as the main characters.

Because of this, Monk is forced into an ultimatum; move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper price.Also, Monk's estranged brother Cliff (Sterling K. Brown) has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife, frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters. We later see that Cliff, whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay, is now at odds with Agnes due to her homophobic views on family values, putting a strain on his relationship with her. I was highly impressed with the way director Cord Jefferson was able to juggle all of Monk's family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story. Most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department, but Jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point across.In his best film performance to date, Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job in the role of Monk.

The movie spends a lot of time on all the ways that Jeffrey Wright feels overwhelmed by his life's responsibilities, and it sags in some of these parts, and makes the movie feel a little bit like a slog. And I don't know that I ever completely believed the character played by Sterling K. Brown, who never seemed convincing as a gay man. But I did like what the film had to say about the burden placed on black people to constantly be representing black people everywhere that white people never have to deal with. And I also liked the choose your own adventure ending that takes the film into meta territory in its final scenes.So, solid double for me, but not a home run.Grade: A-","13 January 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Razor-sharp satire of White preoccupation with African American stereotypes.","steiner-sam","American Fiction is a rightfully angry satire that gets a lot of laughs out of showing how the industry isn't as progressive as it thinks it is. What makes it even better is that it's also a surprisingly investing family drama that is exactly the kind of film it's complaining there aren't enough of.The only thing that doesn't entirely land is the ending. It's still on point with everything the film has been saying for the past 2 hours and it is gloriously meta but it feels like it comes at the cost of an actually satisfying resolution to the character based drama it's been focusing on. Regardless, it's an interesting swing.Jeffrey Wright is amazing in an all too rare leading role. It's the constant shock at how gullible everyone is, the glee in writing his parody book (which is visualised in a fun way) and the quieter moments of reflection. It offers further proof of his comedic talents and shows he can command the screen, though that was never in doubt.With tons of charisma and a restrained sadness, Sterling K. Brown is really good, even if this performance doesn't feel Academy Award worthy. However, that's more of a general complaint with watching films after the nominations are announced since it adds a distracting and unfair disadvantage to any performance nominated.Cord Jefferson makes an impressive debut with both his screenplay and direction. The writing has so much wit and the direction has the visual staging to back it up for some very clever gags. Laura Karpman's score accomplishes the difficult task of being a constant presence without becoming overbearing thanks to its calm and easygoing nature.","5 January 2024","9/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","This is what great writing can do","FeastMode","I was looking forward to this. It's as funny as I anticipated and didn't disappoint. I loved the humor, like the way Issa Rae talked about her book, then proceeding to read it. I remember how much and how often the theatre broke out in laughter.It's a story of a black writer who is tired of society's tend to stereotypes so he writes a crappy novel with intention of purely just trolling, but people eat it up and it becomes a best seller. I think in a way, the movie itself is like that; it tries to divert away from what you'd typically expect from a black story, that sounds weird... from a story based on black characters lol. It reminded me of ""The Photograph (2020),"" an okay romance movie (with Issa Rae too) that I liked because of its portrayal of a love story between two Black individuals, where the essence of romance took center stage instead being overly focused on their race or any associated struggles.Loved how it was directed, the subtle yet not so subtle instances of race even though Thelonious. The social commentary was done really well and did not need to be shoved down your face to be effective. The characters are very easy to get invested in, even the ones that are short lived. I've only seen Jeffery Wright in supporting roles but he really nails his performance as a lead here which was great.It's a film that balances deep emotions with humor, a difficult feat to achieve. Loved how there's a lot going on without the movie feeling overly crowded. It seamlessly combines satire and social commentary with a compelling family drama, and surprisingly, they harmonize flawlessly. Despite not being fast-paced, the film feels tightly packed, dedicating time to explore both themes thoroughly. Moreover, the quick-witted dialogue adds an extra layer of brilliance. Undoubtedly, this stands out as one of my favorite films of the year. The anticipation I had for it was met, and it truly stands as a unique movie.","31 December 2023","7/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","One of the Best Premises of the Year","evanston_dad","There are a lot of things to like (or that have potential) in American Fiction. It features a strong cast-especially the lead-and is built upon an extremely interesting/entertaining satirical concept. The main problem it faces, however, is that the constant switching back and forth between intense family drama and farcical satire needed to either be better balanced or shifted from one camp to the other a bit more. As-is, the experience is odd/wearisome even if still watchable.For a very basic overview, American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a stoic/up-tight writer who wants the Black experience portrayed as more than the usual caricatures or stereotypes. When a new book comes out that panders to that lowest common denominator, Monk is as apoplectic as he is depressed. But with family/money issues on the mind, he (bit-by-bit) gets pulled into writing an ""African-American vernacular"" piece that-of course-absolutely blows up and causes some severe conflicts of interest.As written by Percival Everett & Cord Jefferson (also the director), American Fiction is, on one hand, a pretty entertaining satire of Black representation in American culture. Maybe a little on the nose, but that is sort of the overall point of the entire piece. It is easy to laugh at what is transpiring while also reflecting upon how close it creeps to the truth.On the other hand, American Fiction also wants to be a pretty intense family drama, dealing with weighty issues like depression, mental health (as it applies to aging), and sexual orientation. While these plot-points and themes are not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I'd argue that they take away from the power of the satirical elements. I never made the connection between the wildly different tones-either because I missed some of Jefferson's nuance or it simply wasn't present.My favorite scene in this movie was seeing Wright go through a physical transformation-intellectual/academic to ""street""-walking down a hallway. I wish American Fiction could have tapped into that sort of energy much more than it ultimately did. Because audiences are so used to seeing Wright as the buttoned-up serious actor, highlighting his ability to play any type of role (which is clearly present, even if only in spurts here) would have potentially done wonders.As it stands, however, American Fiction left me feeling a little confused/hollow as to what the whole experience was all about. It is clearly well-produced and has a professional feel to it so I'd never call it a bad film, but I often felt its best potential qualities were somewhat marginalized in favor of plotlines that didn't seem to pay off in the endgame.","18 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","satire at it's best","ferguson-6","This film was hilarious. I laughed more than I have during a movie in a long time. The commentary about the publishing industry and Hollywood was spot on. The acting was great and character development was well done. People in theater were laughing loudly throughout the film. That is the first time I've been to a film for adults where people were laughing constantly. I loved every moment and wanted the movie to just keep going, will watch again when released for streaming. My favorite part of the film was the commentary around how Americans feel like being ""more thuggish"" is more black and ""real"". Often times you see this trope. I want to see a film about stories that haven't been told before. Stop doing the same thing over and over Hollywood. This film is a nice break from the typical film.","6 February 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Earnest drama first, satire second","masonsaul","An author, dejected by the state of society and what readers consider black literature, decides to give the people what they want: a stereotypical black story. What was supposed to be a satirical commentary turns into something more than he ever expected.This film is an adaptation of the novel Erasure by Percival Everett. The film is a good mix of drama and comedy. One storyline makes fun of how, even though society is becoming more accepting of minorities, it unintentionally marginalizes them by continuing to perpetuate stereotypes. At the same time, another storyline shows an individual struggling with the hardships of life. The film's display of irony makes it an intriguing watch and reflects our current state as a society. This is a great film to watch with friends and discuss afterward.","13 December 2023","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","""I'm black and it's my book""","AfricanBro","The movie American Fiction starts off with a bang of a scene that makes you think, ""Oh. This is going to be amazing."" From beginning to end, there are a number of sharp, brilliant, stingingly funny scenes. But they're interspersed between what feels like another movie - a bittersweet yet heartwarming family drama. Two movies with the same characters running along a parallel story arc that occasionally intersect. On more than one occasion I found myself asking, wait, which movie am I watching?First, there is the movie as described in the IMDB synopsis: ""Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a frustrated novelist who's fed up with the establishment profiting from ""Black"" entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write his own outlandish ""Black"" book--that propels him into the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.""This movie is awesome. But it only shows up on occasion as what sometimes feels like a sub-plot of the other movie.The other movie also stars Jeffrey Wright as Monk, same frustrated, emotionally disconnected, lost character. He takes a highly-encouraged leave of absence from his university teaching job and goes and reconnects with his emotionally damaged and broken yet still loving family. The great cast includes Tracee Ellis Ross as his accomplished, primary-bearer-of-responsibility sister; Sterling K. Brown as his middle-aged, recently-heterosexually-divorced, now out-gay-and-on-the-prowl brother; and, best of all, the legendary Leslie Uggams as his rapidly-on-the-decline-but-won't-acknowledge-it mother. Monk gradually, reluctantly takes more and more responsibility to care for his mother and be an active brother, accomplishing some middle age growing up in the process. It's a very nice, warm, if not particularly inspiring movie. It serves as the narrative background for the first movie.The first movie is also a kind of journey of maturity, responsibility and self-discovery, along with being a biting and very funny satire. It's way more interesting and fun. Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time there. It's too bad, because each time it reappeared I thought, now THIS is the movie that I want to see. The effect is a feeling of story-drive interruptus. The first movie brings a level of building tension that wets your appetite with anticipation (OMG, what's going to happen next? I can't look but want to look!). And then it drops that tension and momentum when we move back to what is actually the main story line with him and his family. I kept feeling like, no wait, don't go back to the family movie, stay with this one!The good thing is that it comes back around to the first movie at the end with a climax scene that is sharp, cynical and hilarious.","2 February 2024","8/10"
"American Fiction (2023)","Needed Either Better Balance Or More Comedic Focus","zkonedog","It was a good time at the movies going to see American Fiction. It's not a story that I have not heard in some form or fashion before but the dramatic content made it fresh over just being a comedy.Speaking of comedy Sterling K. Brown was hilarious in the film. He just kept me laughing every time he was on the screen.American Fiction makes a lot of points without needing to take a side and was more about the character development of Thelonious Ellison played by Jeffery Wright as he deals with life and his family.This movie has a lot of substance to it, from the smallest sub plot that was just as engaging to go through as the main one. Its a very complete film.","7 January 2024","6/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","Controlling emotions","TheLittleSongbird","'Turning Red' (2022)Opening thoughts: Pixar is one of the finest animation studios to exist and one of the few studios today for anything to continually deliver. Sure they did become less consistent post-'Toy Story 3', but in the 90s and 2000s their work was of higher quality than Disney's generally and hit more than it missed. Pre-'Toy Story 3', the one slight disappointment was 'Cars', the others are very good to brilliant and even their lesser work is still watchable.'Turning Red' appealed to me immediately when looking for things to watch when on a three week cruise last year where there was a lot of film and television watching in the evenings and on the at sea days. Really liked the concept, unique for Pixar, and the message. 'Turning Red' is not one of Pixar's best films and can understand why people had issues regarding its target audience (admittedly not as accessible as other films from the studio), but it is still very good with relatable themes handled with fun and emotion and one of the better films seen on the cruise.Bad things: Some of the awkwardness is a little too overkill in the humour, especially between the four friends early on.Also felt that the darker tone seen at the concert, where the mother in red panda form was reminiscent of something like 'Jurassic Park' or Godzilla, clashed a bit too much with the rest of the film.Good things: However, there is so much to praise. The animation, as per usual, is stunning. Absolutely loved the vivid colours and the very rich attention to detail in the character animation. The character animation on the panda and the background art and visual effects at the end standing out. The music really enhances the story's wild energy, and ""Nobody Like You"" sticks in the memory for a long time.Did also really enjoy the writing on the whole. The humour is sharp, hip and witty, of course there are awkward spots but that was hardly uncommon in adolescence (a lot of it actually at my school) and how adolescent children acted and still do. The cool geekiness of the four main characters took me back, being somewhat a geek myself and it stood out in both a good and bad way, and adolescence and the mature themes are depicted entertainingly and with heart. The atmosphere didn't feel out of date and was affectionately handled, some may have issues with some of the characters' negative actions, but the film isn't encouraging anybody to do them, just showing that they do happen, and in a realistic way.Loved the story's wild energy and often infectious wackiness. Also how inventively the culture of the family was shown, in a way that was intriguing and expansive. Having never seen a family backstory like this before, so it felt fresh and original. The mother and daughter relationship was beautifully realised and realistic, both points of view understandable and not hard to relate to.A great job is done with the emotional side of the film, especially in the truly heart-wrenchingly powerful climax. And with the message, one that was brave to tackle and also one that is universal and relatable. Luckily delivered in those ways here and not heavy handedly. The friendships and outcome warm the heart. The characters are strongly written and the voice acting is top notch, particularly Sandra Oh.Closing thoughts: Overall, not one of Pixar's best and not for all but very good and hardly a waste of the studio's most unique concept.8/10.","12 March 2022","8/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","Massively cute, often very funny, poignant, heart rending and warming and breaking and gorgeous all the time.

So many young people come to find that their parents, one and/or both depending on the time, become way too much to deal with, and that finding attraction in others is something immediate and pleasurable and also forms friendships (like 4-Town... ugh and they're 5 teens what gives). So many don't know what to do with their bodies as they sprout hair all over and hormones rage like a furnace. Is it possible to find your ""center"" when you're 13?Turning Red is no different than, say, the 400 Blows in addressing how a young person finds themselves at a crossroads of life and choosing a way to go is a conundrum on top of a pain-pile some days, this despite/because of the joys that come with being young and (sometimes/discovering one likes to be) carefree and DGAF about stuff like school and routines and rituals. That these two films are from very different countries and times and protagonists isn't the point, rather that Domee Shii, like Truffaut or Greta Gerwig or Reiner/King with a Stand by Me or (insert other Coming of Age serio-comic saga), finds through her art some compelling ways to express how these changes are vast and cruel and bewildering.In this case, Mei doesn't know what to quite do with her Panda-y self, or more significantly with what her mother wants her to do with it. It's a film ultimately about familial vs self expectations, and it's realized and executed with a heck of a lot of heart, wit, intense cuteness (that box of kittens made me laugh hard), and enough pathos to crash through a dozen concerts. I do have a few nitpicks on my first viewing, some maybe a little minor that I know come with suspending a bit of disbelief (there was never any time the parents thought to mention the whole Panda-transformation curse thing), and some maybe not as much (not to give too many spoilers away, but would 4-Town or their legions of fans react like *that* after what happens in the climax of the movie?

I love the characters, the vision of Toronto, and so much to do with how we all as younger people struggled through the UGH and AAGH of so much, and it's a movie that manages to remind the adults how profound it can be to confront that and reflect on it all.

But it comes across as hollow because from the film's opening scene she says that she takes pride in being independent. So, there's no change in values for her. She just becomes more outspoken.Also, I found the movie rather distasteful in that it seems to encourage rebelling against your parents because they'll never understand you, as opposed to appreciating what they do for you and having honest, open two-way communication with them.Lastly, good gracious this is one of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen.

"Turning Red (2022)","Controlling emotions","TheLittleSongbird","'Turning Red' (2022)Opening thoughts: Pixar is one of the finest animation studios to exist and one of the few studios today for anything to continually deliver. Sure they did become less consistent post-'Toy Story 3', but in the 90s and 2000s their work was of higher quality than Disney's generally and hit more than it missed. Pre-'Toy Story 3', the one slight disappointment was 'Cars', the others are very good to brilliant and even their lesser work is still watchable.'Turning Red' appealed to me immediately when looking for things to watch when on a three week cruise last year where there was a lot of film and television watching in the evenings and on the at sea days. Really liked the concept, unique for Pixar, and the message. 'Turning Red' is not one of Pixar's best films and can understand why people had issues regarding its target audience (admittedly not as accessible as other films from the studio), but it is still very good with relatable themes handled with fun and emotion and one of the better films seen on the cruise.Bad things: Some of the awkwardness is a little too overkill in the humour, especially between the four friends early on.Also felt that the darker tone seen at the concert, where the mother in red panda form was reminiscent of something like 'Jurassic Park' or Godzilla, clashed a bit too much with the rest of the film.Good things: However, there is so much to praise. The animation, as per usual, is stunning. Absolutely loved the vivid colours and the very rich attention to detail in the character animation. The character animation on the panda and the background art and visual effects at the end standing out. The music really enhances the story's wild energy, and ""Nobody Like You"" sticks in the memory for a long time.Did also really enjoy the writing on the whole. The humour is sharp, hip and witty, of course there are awkward spots but that was hardly uncommon in adolescence (a lot of it actually at my school) and how adolescent children acted and still do. The cool geekiness of the four main characters took me back, being somewhat a geek myself and it stood out in both a good and bad way, and adolescence and the mature themes are depicted entertainingly and with heart. The atmosphere didn't feel out of date and was affectionately handled, some may have issues with some of the characters' negative actions, but the film isn't encouraging anybody to do them, just showing that they do happen, and in a realistic way.Loved the story's wild energy and often infectious wackiness. Also how inventively the culture of the family was shown, in a way that was intriguing and expansive. Having never seen a family backstory like this before, so it felt fresh and original. The mother and daughter relationship was beautifully realised and realistic, both points of view understandable and not hard to relate to.A great job is done with the emotional side of the film, especially in the truly heart-wrenchingly powerful climax. And with the message, one that was brave to tackle and also one that is universal and relatable. Luckily delivered in those ways here and not heavy handedly. The friendships and outcome warm the heart. The characters are strongly written and the voice acting is top notch, particularly Sandra Oh.Closing thoughts: Overall, not one of Pixar's best and not for all but very good and hardly a waste of the studio's most unique concept.8/10.","12 March 2022","8/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","Massively cute, often very funny, poignant, heart rending and warming and breaking and gorgeous all the time. It's another Pixar!","Quinoa1984","Turning Red features a predominantly East Asian cast and is about the growing pains that come for a young adolescent and her mother - oh, mothers and daughters, the things that come between them are about as (in this case) building busting as the love that invariably keeps them together - but it's an absolutely universal story. So many young people come to find that their parents, one and/or both depending on the time, become way too much to deal with, and that finding attraction in others is something immediate and pleasurable and also forms friendships (like 4-Town... ugh and they're 5 teens what gives). So many don't know what to do with their bodies as they sprout hair all over and hormones rage like a furnace. Is it possible to find your ""center"" when you're 13?Turning Red is no different than, say, the 400 Blows in addressing how a young person finds themselves at a crossroads of life and choosing a way to go is a conundrum on top of a pain-pile some days, this despite/because of the joys that come with being young and (sometimes/discovering one likes to be) carefree and DGAF about stuff like school and routines and rituals. That these two films are from very different countries and times and protagonists isn't the point, rather that Domee Shii, like Truffaut or Greta Gerwig or Reiner/King with a Stand by Me or (insert other Coming of Age serio-comic saga), finds through her art some compelling ways to express how these changes are vast and cruel and bewildering.In this case, Mei doesn't know what to quite do with her Panda-y self, or more significantly with what her mother wants her to do with it. It's a film ultimately about familial vs self expectations, and it's realized and executed with a heck of a lot of heart, wit, intense cuteness (that box of kittens made me laugh hard), and enough pathos to crash through a dozen concerts. I do have a few nitpicks on my first viewing, some maybe a little minor that I know come with suspending a bit of disbelief (there was never any time the parents thought to mention the whole Panda-transformation curse thing), and some maybe not as much (not to give too many spoilers away, but would 4-Town or their legions of fans react like *that* after what happens in the climax of the movie? I don't know if I fully buy it, even if it still makes for a heart-pulling finale). And on a more fundamental level, you can kind of see what's going to happen with the Mom pretty early on.But these little points don't take away from this being another triumph for Pixar - I almost want to say yawn another but these things are so much harder to pull together and click all into place than most realize - and Shii fulfilling her promise after the dynamic High-Cute Big-Cry energy from Bao (which if you watch again, as I did, is thematically so similar to Red). I love the characters, the vision of Toronto, and so much to do with how we all as younger people struggled through the UGH and AAGH of so much, and it's a movie that manages to remind the adults how profound it can be to confront that and reflect on it all. If it falls short of All Time Masterpiece that may be more on me than it will be for you.","13 March 2022","9/10"

The atmosphere didn't feel out of date and was affectionately handled, some may have issues with some of the characters' negative actions, but the film isn't encouraging anybody to do them, just showing that they do happen, and in a realistic way.Loved the story's wild energy and often infectious wackiness. Also how inventively the culture of the family was shown, in a way that was intriguing and expansive. Having never seen a family backstory like this before, so it felt fresh and original. The mother and daughter relationship was beautifully realised and realistic, both points of view understandable and not hard to relate to.A great job is done with the emotional side of the film, especially in the truly heart-wrenchingly powerful climax. And with the message, one that was brave to tackle and also one that is universal and relatable. Luckily delivered in those ways here and not heavy handedly. The friendships and outcome warm the heart. The characters are strongly written and the voice acting is top notch, particularly Sandra Oh.Closing thoughts: Overall, not one of Pixar's best and not for all but very good and hardly a waste of the studio's most unique concept.8/10.","12 March 2022","8/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","Massively cute, often very funny, poignant, heart rending and warming and breaking and gorgeous all the time. It's another Pixar!","Quinoa1984","Turning Red features a predominantly East Asian cast and is about the growing pains that come for a young adolescent and her mother - oh, mothers and daughters, the things that come between them are about as (in this case) building busting as the love that invariably keeps them together - but it's an absolutely universal story. So many young people come to find that their parents, one and/or both depending on the time, become way too much to deal with, and that finding attraction in others is something immediate and pleasurable and also forms friendships (like 4-Town... ugh and they're 5 teens what gives). So many don't know what to do with their bodies as they sprout hair all over and hormones rage like a furnace. Is it possible to find your ""center"" when you're 13?Turning Red is no different than, say, the 400 Blows in addressing how a young person finds themselves at a crossroads of life and choosing a way to go is a conundrum on top of a pain-pile some days, this despite/because of the joys that come with being young and (sometimes/discovering one likes to be) carefree and DGAF about stuff like school and routines and rituals. That these two films are from very different countries and times and protagonists isn't the point, rather that Domee Shii, like Truffaut or Greta Gerwig or Reiner/King with a Stand by Me or (insert other Coming of Age serio-comic saga), finds through her art some compelling ways to express how these changes are vast and cruel and bewildering.In this case, Mei doesn't know what to quite do with her Panda-y self, or more significantly with what her mother wants her to do with it. It's a film ultimately about familial vs self expectations, and it's realized and executed with a heck of a lot of heart, wit, intense cuteness (that box of kittens made me laugh hard), and enough pathos to crash through a dozen concerts. I do have a few nitpicks on my first viewing, some maybe a little minor that I know come with suspending a bit of disbelief (there was never any time the parents thought to mention the whole Panda-transformation curse thing), and some maybe not as much (not to give too many spoilers away, but would 4-Town or their legions of fans react like *that* after what happens in the climax of the movie? I don't know if I fully buy it, even if it still makes for a heart-pulling finale). And on a more fundamental level, you can kind of see what's going to happen with the Mom pretty early on.But these little points don't take away from this being another triumph for Pixar - I almost want to say yawn another but these things are so much harder to pull together and click all into place than most realize - and Shii fulfilling her promise after the dynamic High-Cute Big-Cry energy from Bao (which if you watch again, as I did, is thematically so similar to Red). I love the characters, the vision of Toronto, and so much to do with how we all as younger people struggled through the UGH and AAGH of so much, and it's a movie that manages to remind the adults how profound it can be to confront that and reflect on it all. If it falls short of All Time Masterpiece that may be more on me than it will be for you.","13 March 2022","9/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","coming of age Pixar","SnoopyStyle","It's 2002 Toronto. Meilin is a 13 year-old Chinese-Canadian girl on the verge of adulthood. Her family cares for their temple honorable their ancestor who turned into a red panda to defend her family. One morning, she wakes up to find herself transformed into a red panda.This is a coming-of-age story from Pixar. It's fun. I love the characters. There is a realism in these characters. They feel very authentic. Aside from the supernatural, this is really a story of a girl trying to find her way through puberty and dealing with her mother-daughter relationship. There are no big name actors other than Sandra Oh which does give this a feeling of non-Hollywood. The Toronto locations are also part of that. This has plenty of fun while dealing with some real tween issues.","25 March 2022","8/10"
"Turning Red (2022)","The struggle is real ... and red","kosmasp","Red Pandas ... I know someone who loves them more than anything else. In this case the red panda stands for something more. The whole movie is about womanhood ... or rather a girl becoming a woman. That time in between actually.I understand if this isn't everyones cup of tea. The movie is almost entirely aimed at girls. Having said that, you can enjoy this being something else entirely too. Because the characters are well written and funny. Are they over the top? I mean of course they are - the main character literally transforms when she has mood swings/changes ... how could this not be over the top and exaggerated? You just have to go with the flow.Engaging and really fun, still has some issues with cliches if you care. But it also is one of the best animated movies of the year. You can call it woke, you can call it cringe ... but the target audience loves it. And that is just showing that the movie achieved what it set out to do. I don't think or believe I know what goes on or happens in puberty with young girls ... but this movie probably gets as close to it, while remaining entertaining and funny as it can be.","12 March 2022","10/10"

Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner.A narrative that unquestionably explores the hormonal, emotional, and sexual developments of its characters, conveying a message of self-acceptance and understanding of human evolution through its metaphors loaded with youthful excitement.With the well-known technical attributes from the successful studio, this film will serve as an essential companion for all pre-teens who will deal with or are going through this inevitable and ""inconvenient"" phase of life.One of the best movies of the year until this day.""Rating: A-","13 March 2022","7/10"

"Turning Red (2022)","Comedic Coming of Age Film","hdog-94019","Well, the animation is often creative and incorporates some anime elements to highlight the culture on display.Let's see...what else positive can I say?... There is an attempt at strong characterization as Mei learns to be independent and learns the value of her independence. But it comes across as hollow because from the film's opening scene she says that she takes pride in being independent. So, there's no change in values for her. She just becomes more outspoken.Also, I found the movie rather distasteful in that it seems to encourage rebelling against your parents because they'll never understand you, as opposed to appreciating what they do for you and having honest, open two-way communication with them.Lastly, good gracious this is one of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. The writing and dialogue often comes across as a horribly dated Disney channel movie from 2002. The movie is loud, anxious, and obnoxious for almost the entirety of its runtime.This is Pixar's first true misstep since Cars 2. I guess they can do wrong.","12 March 2022","7/10"

Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4.

The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute.

""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","I don't understand the great scores of this movie","antti-eskelinen-329-929792","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it!

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","""Yeah.""","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.(5 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023, UltraScreen 3/28/2023, SuperScreen 4/10/2023, re-issue IMAX 5/2/2023, 9/22/2023)","28 May 2023","5/10"

I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Ridiculous, boring and pathetic...","drjgardner","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","29 March 2023","2/10"

Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","24 March 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","""Yeah.""","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Disappointed.","dstan-71445","By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.","30 March 2023","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Ridiculous, boring and pathetic...","drjgardner","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","29 March 2023","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","There is such a thing as too much","neil-476","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","23 May 2023","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","What a pointless film","siderite","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","25 March 2023","4/10"

I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10"

I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Ridiculous, boring and pathetic...","drjgardner","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","29 March 2023","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","There is such a thing as too much","neil-476","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","23 May 2023","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","What a pointless film","siderite","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","25 March 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","It got on my wick.","BA_Harrison","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","I was rolling my eyes the whole time... all 3 hours...","namob-43673","What is all the raving about with this movie? I felt it lacked a decent storyline and was 2 hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter. The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?Yes we.","24 March 2023","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","John Wick became the parody of himself. The true identity of this franchise is completely lost.","fciocca","Very much over rated. Repetitive, tiring and inauthentic fight choreography for 3 hrs straight. Unnatural and generic one liner filled script. No deep drama whatsoever. Just bland, perpetual killings till one is numb. Awful and fake seeming blood effects. Bland, cliched action hero.All these characterize John Wick 4. These movies keep getting shallower with every sequel. The little soul the first two had is dead and buried here. I don't get the hype. John Wick has become like those generic, action B movies with cliched scripts and characters. Not to forget the unlikable and uncharismatic addition, black guy with a dog. He was as dull as it gets.Beautiful cinematography though. Loved some of the scenes except the CGI ones. A point for that I guess.","2 April 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Am I missing something here?","skyhawk747","...all at the same time. This hybrid comic book-video game has a stupid plot, worse than average acting, and fight scenes that are so poorly done you don't mind going to the bathroom. Don't get me wrong. I loved John Wick 1. Thought #2 was OK. Then came #3., It showed they were out of imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1. The photography is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless. Save the money and the time.","23 April 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","I don't understand the great scores of this movie","antti-eskelinen-329-929792","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","24 March 2023","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","""Yeah.""","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road).

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","One of the best horror films I've seen in a while!","ethanbresnett","Talk to Me is a stone cold classic of the horror genre. It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.","3 August 2023","8/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","The hand of pure evil.","Sleepin_Dragon","A group of youngsters discover that by taking part in a small ritual involving an embalmed, ceramic hand, that they're able to contact spirits from the other side.One of the better horror films I've seen for some time, when I compare to the other horrors I've seen in 2023, this rates as the best so far.Talk to me has a degree of originality, it's loaded with jump scares, and has some genuinely memorable moments. The writing was rather good, everything pieced together nicely, including that pretty shocking opening sequence.Quite graphic at times, it wasn't afraid to show a bit of gore, eyeball, that's all I'm saying, I had to look away. I loved that deliciously dark closing scene, it was such a strong, cohesive end to the film, it really worked.There were a couple of clichés, and there were a couple of moments where you're left scratching your head, puzzling whether people would actually do the things that happened here, but those are minor faults, the only major gripe I had, was the rebirth of The Crazy Frog music (I thought our ears had been spared that years ago.)They trailered Cobweb and Nun 2, will either of them surpass this one? Will have to wait and see.A big thumbs up.8/10.","27 July 2023","8/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","I Feel Sick.","fletcherw928","Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.","11 July 2023","9/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","A mix of amazing and not so good","FeastMode","I watched Talk to Me early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. It's a movie I'd already planned on seeing, so I was happy with the choice while also having no idea what to expect. I came out of the movie very mixed.There are lots of positives, the biggest being some truly awesome horror moments. My jaw dropped multiple times at some of these brutal moments. And with an R-rating, it didn't have to hold back. I wish more movies had the courage to do this instead of opting for a milder PG-13 movie, pandering to the casuals and teens.The movie is mostly well-made. I love how loud the sound effects are. Sophie Wilde gives a great performance and Joe Bird has some amazing moments. It also uses the horror premise in a few unique ways, making it more like a game or a drug.Unfortunately not everything works. It doesn't seem like it knows where to go and doesn't come together all that well. A few of the scares involve grossing out the audience. I don't find gross to be scary. It's just nasty.But the worst thing, for me at least, is I was not nearly as engaged as I should have been during the climax. I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was sort of just... there.I heard someone call this the Smile of 2023, a surprise horror flick that comes out of nowhere and blows everyone away. I don't think it comes close to Smile, my favorite movie of last year.I can see some people loving this, but I can't personally recommend it.(1 viewing, Mystery Movie Monday 7/10/2023)","12 September 2023","5/10"

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Didn't quite hit the mark","jtindahouse","I've spoken in the past about being a big fan of Australian horror movies. Some of my all time favourites have come from this country. So it's a little disappointing that the last two Australian horror movies I've watched ('Run Rabbit Run' and 'Talk to Me') have been a bit of a let down. The latter was nowhere near as big of a let down as the former to be fair. There were parts of this film I liked, but overall it didn't quite hit the right spots.I'm finding possession films less and less scary with every year that goes by. I find that as soon as you see the ghosts/demons it's just too hard to believe (even though the make-up work in 'Talk to Me' was very well done). The only time it really works for me any more is in films like 'Paranormal Activity' where you rarely actually see anything. Seeing less will always be more in this circumstance.So I didn't find the film overly scary, and then all I really have to fall back on is the characters. Sadly we've reached a point where the only way to write realistic teenage characters any more is to make them extremely unpleasant. If they were all overly nice it wouldn't feel like they were properly written, yet if they are particularly unpleasant then it isn't much fun to watch them. It's a real predicament that the horror genre has and I don't know the way around it.I will say that the ghosts/demons were done in such a way that if that is the kind of thing that scares you I could see this movie being very effective and creepy. Otherwise though, you might be fresh out of luck with this one. 6/10.","13 September 2023","6/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Great premise, subpar execution.","manuelasaez","The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.","13 September 2023","5/10"

Mustn't forget some of the stoopidist suspension of logic flaws I've seen in a horror movie for some time. After the Police arrived, and left, the whole plot collapsed. For a horror movie to really work, it has to draw you in with realistic, everyday likelihoods. The cops would have shut the house down, taken all the phone footage and confiscated the hand. They did none of the above.. Now a hand that allows you to contact the dead I'm prepared to give a pass.

In this film it's an embalmed hand.Naturally the main characters have a traumatic backstory, with their mother having passed in an untimely manner.

Bad things happen.If you've suffered through bad music, bad acting and bad party scenes until that point in the film, you can be relieved.

It significantly improves as it goes along.There are some good ideas here, but sadly they're never fully developed or fully explained. The ending is by far the strongest part of the film, but the buildup to it remains virtually unexplained. It's a pity, because there would have been room for a good moral dilemma. Still, the last scene is great and redeems the second half of the film.On a technical level, the film is competently made. The color grading looks really nice, which is almost a rarity in films these days. The scary scenes are very well filmed and the audio editing is top notch. Audio is the most important aspect of a horror film, and they nail it here.

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","One of the best horror films I've seen in a while!","ethanbresnett","Talk to Me is a stone cold classic of the horror genre. It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.","3 August 2023","8/10"

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","I Feel Sick.","fletcherw928","Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.","11 July 2023","9/10"

I came out of the movie very mixed.There are lots of positives, the biggest being some truly awesome horror moments. My jaw dropped multiple times at some of these brutal moments.

I wish more movies had the courage to do this instead of opting for a milder PG-13 movie, pandering to the casuals and teens.The movie is mostly well-made. I love how loud the sound effects are. Sophie Wilde gives a great performance and Joe Bird has some amazing moments. It also uses the horror premise in a few unique ways, making it more like a game or a drug.Unfortunately not everything works. It doesn't seem like it knows where to go and doesn't come together all that well. A few of the scares involve grossing out the audience. I don't find gross to be scary.

There were parts of this film I liked, but overall it didn't quite hit the right spots.I'm finding possession films less and less scary with every year that goes by. I find that as soon as you see the ghosts/demons it's just too hard to believe (even though the make-up work in 'Talk to Me' was very well done). The only time it really works for me any more is in films like 'Paranormal Activity' where you rarely actually see anything. Seeing less will always be more in this circumstance.So I didn't find the film overly scary, and then all I really have to fall back on is the characters. Sadly we've reached a point where the only way to write realistic teenage characters any more is to make them extremely unpleasant. If they were all overly nice it wouldn't feel like they were properly written, yet if they are particularly unpleasant then it isn't much fun to watch them. It's a real predicament that the horror genre has and I don't know the way around it.I will say that the ghosts/demons were done in such a way that if that is the kind of thing that scares you I could see this movie being very effective and creepy. Otherwise though, you might be fresh out of luck with this one. 6/10.","13 September 2023","6/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Great premise, subpar execution.","manuelasaez","The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.","13 September 2023","5/10"

Mustn't forget some of the stoopidist suspension of logic flaws I've seen in a horror movie for some time. After the Police arrived, and left, the whole plot collapsed. For a horror movie to really work, it has to draw you in with realistic, everyday likelihoods. The cops would have shut the house down, taken all the phone footage and confiscated the hand. They did none of the above.. Now a hand that allows you to contact the dead I'm prepared to give a pass.

This time from Australia, but aside from the accents it looks and feels entirely American. The usual ingredients are all there. A cast of annoying, loudmoth, diverse, phone addicted teenagers come across cursed artifact that allows them to contact the spirit realm and become briefly possessed. In this film it's an embalmed hand.Naturally the main characters have a traumatic backstory, with their mother having passed in an untimely manner. They end up talking to her, but stay connected to the other side for too long. Bad things happen.If you've suffered through bad music, bad acting and bad party scenes until that point in the film, you can be relieved. Things do get better, which is a rarity for the horror genre. Usually they start strong and run out of steam. This one is the opposite. It significantly improves as it goes along.There are some good ideas here, but sadly they're never fully developed or fully explained. The ending is by far the strongest part of the film, but the buildup to it remains virtually unexplained. It's a pity, because there would have been room for a good moral dilemma. Still, the last scene is great and redeems the second half of the film.On a technical level, the film is competently made. The color grading looks really nice, which is almost a rarity in films these days. The scary scenes are very well filmed and the audio editing is top notch. Audio is the most important aspect of a horror film, and they nail it here. The rotating camera gimmick is fun, but gets overused.If you can get through the horrible first half, you might get some enjoyment out of this. Overall, I couldn't enjoy it.

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","One of the best horror films I've seen in a while!","ethanbresnett","Talk to Me is a stone cold classic of the horror genre. It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.","3 August 2023","8/10"

The writing was rather good, everything pieced together nicely, including that pretty shocking opening sequence.Quite graphic at times, it wasn't afraid to show a bit of gore, eyeball, that's all I'm saying, I had to look away. I loved that deliciously dark closing scene, it was such a strong, cohesive end to the film, it really worked.There were a couple of clichés, and there were a couple of moments where you're left scratching your head, puzzling whether people would actually do the things that happened here, but those are minor faults, the only major gripe I had, was the rebirth of The Crazy Frog music (I thought our ears had been spared that years ago.)They trailered Cobweb and Nun 2, will either of them surpass this one?

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","I Feel Sick.","fletcherw928","Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.","11 July 2023","9/10"

It's a movie I'd already planned on seeing, so I was happy with the choice while also having no idea what to expect. I came out of the movie very mixed.There are lots of positives, the biggest being some truly awesome horror moments. My jaw dropped multiple times at some of these brutal moments. And with an R-rating, it didn't have to hold back. I wish more movies had the courage to do this instead of opting for a milder PG-13 movie, pandering to the casuals and teens.The movie is mostly well-made. I love how loud the sound effects are. Sophie Wilde gives a great performance and Joe Bird has some amazing moments. It also uses the horror premise in a few unique ways, making it more like a game or a drug.Unfortunately not everything works. It doesn't seem like it knows where to go and doesn't come together all that well. A few of the scares involve grossing out the audience. I don't find gross to be scary. It's just nasty.But the worst thing, for me at least, is I was not nearly as engaged as I should have been during the climax. I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was sort of just... there.I heard someone call this the Smile of 2023, a surprise horror flick that comes out of nowhere and blows everyone away.

"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Great premise, subpar execution.","manuelasaez","The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.","13 September 2023","5/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Was rooting for the hand.","stebai66","Well, I actually had high expectations for this. Read a lot of positive stuff, damn my English teacher. Anyway what we have here is a good idea, ruined by a bunch of characters I hated. A bunch of whiny, self centered teens, with smarts somewhere between a Mars bar and a US President. Mustn't forget some of the stoopidist suspension of logic flaws I've seen in a horror movie for some time. After the Police arrived, and left, the whole plot collapsed. For a horror movie to really work, it has to draw you in with realistic, everyday likelihoods. The cops would have shut the house down, taken all the phone footage and confiscated the hand. They did none of the above.. Now a hand that allows you to contact the dead I'm prepared to give a pass. A bunch of Aussies finest, walking away from a blood splattered crime scene without a hint of concern.. Well your taking the p**s aren't you mate! The Cinematography however was excellent. Kudos to them.","25 August 2023","4/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Insufferable Teens summon Demons Episode 284","kuner-59029","Another week, another jumpscare demon summoning movie. This time from Australia, but aside from the accents it looks and feels entirely American. The usual ingredients are all there. A cast of annoying, loudmoth, diverse, phone addicted teenagers come across cursed artifact that allows them to contact the spirit realm and become briefly possessed. In this film it's an embalmed hand.Naturally the main characters have a traumatic backstory, with their mother having passed in an untimely manner. They end up talking to her, but stay connected to the other side for too long. Bad things happen.If you've suffered through bad music, bad acting and bad party scenes until that point in the film, you can be relieved. Things do get better, which is a rarity for the horror genre. Usually they start strong and run out of steam. This one is the opposite. It significantly improves as it goes along.There are some good ideas here, but sadly they're never fully developed or fully explained. The ending is by far the strongest part of the film, but the buildup to it remains virtually unexplained. It's a pity, because there would have been room for a good moral dilemma. Still, the last scene is great and redeems the second half of the film.On a technical level, the film is competently made. The color grading looks really nice, which is almost a rarity in films these days. The scary scenes are very well filmed and the audio editing is top notch. Audio is the most important aspect of a horror film, and they nail it here. The rotating camera gimmick is fun, but gets overused.If you can get through the horrible first half, you might get some enjoyment out of this. Overall, I couldn't enjoy it. The teens were just too annoying, and the conflict and plot too trite.","24 April 2023","3/10"
"Talk to Me (I) (2022)","Talk to the Hand","kosmasp","Quite literally - and no pun intended of course. Also you have to suspend your disbelief ... like really really suspend it. If you'd ask any of the characters how ... well not intelligent they are, they would answer ... yes. Now if that sounds like it doesn't make sense ... it is because it doesn't make sense ... which I hope makes sense to say/write. It does to me of course.If you are able to handle those things that I would call flaws and not be annoyed by them ... well the movie is every bit as good as you may have heard it is. The horror is quite frightening - the story is tight and the ending ... well that has quite the impact to it. And even if you may see it coming ... it is so well shot and done, it won't matter.A24 knows their stuff and their movies are being hailed for the right reasons most of the time. They are also not easy movies to watch. Violence (peak) and horror of every kind ... you've been warned. Be different than the characters here and heed those warnings ... and act accordingly.","24 July 2023","8/10"

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.","26 February 2024","10/10"

"Dune: Part Two (2024)","Paul Atreides is handled masterfully","poseyfan","In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timothée Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.","26 February 2024","10/10"

"Dune: Part Two (2024)","Paul Atreides is handled masterfully","poseyfan","In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timothée Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.","26 February 2024","10/10"
"Dune: Part Two (2024)","A masterpiece, a pillar of sci-fi/fantasy","awessel-58117","Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10.","7 March 2024","10/10"
"Dune: Part Two (2024)","Visual masterpiece, questionable narrative","thePopcornExplorer","We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.","28 February 2024","7/10"
"Dune: Part Two (2024)","One Of The Greatest Sequel Ever Made, Dune: Part Two Was Easily The Best Films Of The Year So Far","HabibieHakim123","I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.","29 February 2024","10/10"
"The White Lotus (2021–2025)","I enjoyed it!","Supermanfan-13","I went into watching The White Lotus not really knowing what to expect. I just finished the second season and now know why it's had so many great reviews and won so many awards. What makes this show so good is the acting and the writing. Each character is beautifully written and acted, not a weak link on either season. HBO always puts out great content and this is no different. It's not a show for everyone but I definitely enjoyed it. It's one of the rare anthology shows where both seasons are equally as good. I'm now looking forward to future seasons of The White Lotus and hope they stay as good as these first two.","11 December 2022","8/10"
"The White Lotus (2021–2025)","Really well written and acted series!","DiCaprioFan1","The White Lotus is so much better than I expected. Both seasons have all-star casts from top to bottom and all do an incredible job. I can't point that out enough, both casts are perfect. Also, the visuals on this show are just beautiful. This series has already won so many awards for season one and I expect season two to win just as many. It's both funny and serious in how it shows the difference in classes and how some of the wealthy and privileged live their lives. There are no real villains in this show but definitely some frustrating and annoying characters. There are so many great characters that everyone will have their favorite and most annoying.","10 August 2021","9/10"

There's no cliffhangers written with no exact conclusion in mind or series that goes on way past its shelf life. This series is so well done it gives you a definitive, acceptable conclusion that leave little if anything to conclude. It's great when a season of episodes ends and it leaves you begging for more, however it's also great to watch a short series that tells its story while manages to leave no stone on turned and you're satisfied with it's ending and enjoyed it. In a lot of ways I believe this series left a wonderful blueprint for future limited series to come.","18 September 2022","10/10"

I wish I wouldn't have started it so I could binge watch the hole thing. There are parts that it takes a few seconds for your brain to process and then bang OMG laugh out loud funny. Rewind watch again funny. The story telling is masterful. Only thing wrong with this show is can't find anything to it's equal wile waiting for the next one to be released.

"The White Lotus (2021–2025)","This is the BEST dark comedy in years","idospasjody","Though some of the first season was cringe-worthy. This second season is about as masterful as anyone could hope for.It starts a bit slow, the first episode, but soon finds its legs and impresses again and again, captivating me as if I weren't quite seasoned. It feels like a review of every thought I've ever had at a vacation resort, many of which I'd long forgotten. On that score alone it's a delight, but not to worry, it goes way beyond that to flirt with opera-like heights of drama and beauty something quite appropriate given its setting in Sicily.Given the excellence of the acting and the seeming effortlessness of the story I would have to say Mike White, this series' creator, is some sort of unsung genius.

"The White Lotus (2021–2025)","The most impressive series I've ever seen","oasomera","Honestly, this almost feels like an experiment, created to see if it's possible to cram as many cringe-worthy moments as possible in a show, before the viewers give up. It's beautifully packaged, no doubt, with good direction, good cinematography and generally good acting, but I physically hated each and every one of the characters - no one excluded - and spent all my time wondering why their behavior ranged somewhere from mildly deplorable to downright unbearable.I think it wants to be a satirical commentary on a particularly pampered demographic in society: white, oblivious rich people. And sure, it's a fairly well-deserving target for scorn. But it's done in a rather ham-fisted way, with characters who incomprehensibly lack almost any social skills, or act cluelessly in what are otherwise pretty normal situations. It didn't need to be so on-the-nose with the critique - if it indeed is critique - is my point.","21 September 2021","9/10"

I'm very very surprised at how many people love it so much including my friends who were so sure that I would like it too. And it's not even because the characters are unlikable. They are meant to be unlikable and most of the actors do it well. It was very easy to watch so I'll give it that.","7 September 2021","10/10"

Each character is beautifully written and acted, not a weak link on either season. HBO always puts out great content and this is no different. It's not a show for everyone but I definitely enjoyed it. It's one of the rare anthology shows where both seasons are equally as good.

It's both funny and serious in how it shows the difference in classes and how some of the wealthy and privileged live their lives.

There are so many great characters that everyone will have their favorite and most annoying.","10 August 2021","9/10"

There's no cliffhangers written with no exact conclusion in mind or series that goes on way past its shelf life. This series is so well done it gives you a definitive, acceptable conclusion that leave little if anything to conclude.

"The Pacific (2010)","Left Me Devastated","gogoschka-1","I'm guessing most of us watched 'The Pacific' for at least one of the following 3 reasons:1. We have an interest in history, particularly in WW2.2. We are fans of movies and television shows (well, the good ones anyway)3. We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10.

"The Pacific (2010)","This story is finally told in the right way","follis12","The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.The US Marines in the Pacific lived like animals in the most horrible environments imaginable. On top of fighting an enemy committed to kill them at all cost and never surrender, they battled the mud, heat, malaria, near starvation, and isolation for months on end.Basically, it was a total nightmare, and the heroism of all the US Marines in the Pacific theater is nothing short of awe inspiring. The Pacific tells this story well. It is a must see on the topic of WW2.","10 July 2014","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Different from Band of Brothers","SnoopyStyle","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series. This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series. Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it.","28 May 2010","9/10"

"The Pacific (2010)","If you came across this series and you're thinking about watching it. PLEASE DO !!","zahra-michael","If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO's critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers"", change the channel""The Pacific"" differs from ""Band of Brothers"" whereas the ""The Pacific"" focuses on the war itself and ""Band of Brothers"" focused on the characters. Both miniseries are championed by Hollywood heavy-hitters Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who were contributing writers and producers of both miniseries.Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. It is clear that the soldiers in the Pacific theater fought a different kind of war than those fighting in Europe. ""The Pacific"" is a gritty if not gory depiction of a war against not just the Japanese, but also the elements. The cast is made-up of some brilliant actors we are sure to see again in future projects. What makes ""The Pacific"" so good is the intense realism which brings the viewer into the battle from the safety of your couch. If there is hell on earth, you will find it here.The army they are fighting is alien; both mysterious and ferocious. They are looked at with both awe and disdain and the Americans want to kill them all. However, there is a palpable sense fear among the men that this enemy will never surrender and will fight beyond what they feel is humanly if not morally possible. When one character hears about the Kamikaze's flying their planes into ships, he asks aloud ""how can any man do that?"" ""The Pacific"" is fast-paced and each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. What lacks in the series is the intimacy of knowing the characters. They are kept at a distance almost as if the character doesn't want to let you in. This may be the intent of the writers; just as the soldiers took little interest in knowing each other, maybe we are not meant to know the characters.","10 May 2010","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","""The Pacific"" is no ""Band of Brothers"" and it shouldn't be.","johnmcelroynu","I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn't have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men's paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone's reputation. As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life. Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn't much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek's portrayal of Merriel ""Snafu"" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn't think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.I wasn't as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can't make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men's hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it. One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won't say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it.","28 October 2011","6/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Great - once it gets going","Leofwine_draca","Rating: 7/10Themes: World War II, History, Drama, Action, Marines, Americans vs. Japanese, Trauma & Relationships.Review: The premise of this show had the potential for a gut-wrenching story filled with heart and grief, but it didn't manage to fully live up to that potential for me. This series definitely succeeded in showing the violence and hopelessness that went with being at war, but I struggled a little bit with the emotional factor. It lacked some depth for me there, and I was expecting more from it. The pacing was a little off as well and the structure wasn't the best. I have to say I thought the series did get better over time, and the first half truly felt different from the second half.

"The Pacific (2010)","Great job on a monumental task","noelani54","The Pacific does for the War in the Pacific theater. What Band of Brothers did for the European theater. It makes it more realistic. More understanding. and That's not an easy feat to do. As with Band of Brothers there is a large cast here . But the main focus is on only a few soldiers . Not surprising as the source matériel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone. And the others caught in their orbit.Leckie's story is simply the story of a every man caught up in forces he can't control. the Horror and mind breaking conditions he faces as the war progresses almost kills him several times and yet he persists.Eugene sledge is the innocent young man 18 years old who wants to fight who wants to defend his country. And loses his innocence in the process. Sledge's story is the most emotional harrowing one here. Watching his story and the horrors he saw. Makes you wonder how he maintained his sanity. Sledge's friend Snafu is also a joy to watch as he helps Sledge maintain something of normality. In one scene when the new guys show up and snafu asks questions of them like their name sledge replies with a What Now you want to know their names . A common enough thing to happen during th war in which the seasoned vets did'not want to know the names of the new guys because they did not want to mourn them later on. The LAst main focus is Sgt. John Basilone a Marine who wins the medal of honor winner who wins it on Guladcanel after holding off a force of three thousand Japanese soldiers for three days . That story is vividly brought to life as well as his struggles in being a hero doing a War bond drive. and eventually returning to duty on Iwo Jima .The Pacific isn't perfect by any means . but in telling the story of the war. Its as good as it ever gets .","14 March 2010","8/10"

We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10.

"The Pacific (2010)","This story is finally told in the right way","follis12","The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.The US Marines in the Pacific lived like animals in the most horrible environments imaginable. On top of fighting an enemy committed to kill them at all cost and never surrender, they battled the mud, heat, malaria, near starvation, and isolation for months on end.Basically, it was a total nightmare, and the heroism of all the US Marines in the Pacific theater is nothing short of awe inspiring. The Pacific tells this story well. It is a must see on the topic of WW2.","10 July 2014","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Different from Band of Brothers","SnoopyStyle","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series. This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series. Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it.","28 May 2010","9/10"

What a cinematic achievement. The best of the best of what American entertainment has to offer. The scenes and emotions portrayed are so vivid and lifelike that you'll think you've been transported back in time to the pacific theater of war. History has told us how horrid the war against the Japanese was. A war of attrition. This series will take you there and slap you on the wrists and then the face and remind you of the truth. War is utter diabolical hell. And the guys that fought in the pacific during WW2 were tough as nails. Tougher. It's ugly and beautiful at the same time. Enjoy and take a history lesson.

"The Pacific (2010)","Gripping and Powerful","janoffpeter","Well, it is no where as good as Band of Brothers, but the focus is too different. It doesn't stay on a single company and because of that, you kind of don't get what you expected......and what you expected is Band of Brothers in the Pacific theater and, well, without the same company to follow through the war, it doesn't give you that feel of brotherhood that made Band of Brothers so loved.However, you do get a sense of how brutal it was, much more so than the European theater. And that is another source of complaints. People thought it was carnage candy when, the Pacific was actually just carnage.So, really, its a misunderstood cousin.","9 February 2019","10/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","An Honest Review","generationofswine","The Pacific... every time I come across this series I always want to watch it again. The show really shows you what the soldiers that fought in WW2 felt and went through. It's series like this that keep the memory of those brave soldiers who fought for their country alive. And also, the opening theme is... Just hear it for yourself.","5 February 2021","10/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","If you came across this series and you're thinking about watching it. PLEASE DO !!","zahra-michael","If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO's critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers"", change the channel""The Pacific"" differs from ""Band of Brothers"" whereas the ""The Pacific"" focuses on the war itself and ""Band of Brothers"" focused on the characters. Both miniseries are championed by Hollywood heavy-hitters Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who were contributing writers and producers of both miniseries.Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. It is clear that the soldiers in the Pacific theater fought a different kind of war than those fighting in Europe. ""The Pacific"" is a gritty if not gory depiction of a war against not just the Japanese, but also the elements. The cast is made-up of some brilliant actors we are sure to see again in future projects. What makes ""The Pacific"" so good is the intense realism which brings the viewer into the battle from the safety of your couch. If there is hell on earth, you will find it here.The army they are fighting is alien; both mysterious and ferocious. They are looked at with both awe and disdain and the Americans want to kill them all. However, there is a palpable sense fear among the men that this enemy will never surrender and will fight beyond what they feel is humanly if not morally possible. When one character hears about the Kamikaze's flying their planes into ships, he asks aloud ""how can any man do that?"" ""The Pacific"" is fast-paced and each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. What lacks in the series is the intimacy of knowing the characters. They are kept at a distance almost as if the character doesn't want to let you in. This may be the intent of the writers; just as the soldiers took little interest in knowing each other, maybe we are not meant to know the characters.","10 May 2010","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","""The Pacific"" is no ""Band of Brothers"" and it shouldn't be.","johnmcelroynu","I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn't have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men's paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone's reputation. As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life. Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn't much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek's portrayal of Merriel ""Snafu"" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn't think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.I wasn't as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can't make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men's hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it. One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won't say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it.","28 October 2011","6/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Great - once it gets going","Leofwine_draca","Rating: 7/10Themes: World War II, History, Drama, Action, Marines, Americans vs. Japanese, Trauma & Relationships.Review: The premise of this show had the potential for a gut-wrenching story filled with heart and grief, but it didn't manage to fully live up to that potential for me. This series definitely succeeded in showing the violence and hopelessness that went with being at war, but I struggled a little bit with the emotional factor. It lacked some depth for me there, and I was expecting more from it. The pacing was a little off as well and the structure wasn't the best. I have to say I thought the series did get better over time, and the first half truly felt different from the second half. In any case, this was an interesting watch, but it could have been more.","24 November 2010","9/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Great job on a monumental task","noelani54","The Pacific does for the War in the Pacific theater. What Band of Brothers did for the European theater. It makes it more realistic. More understanding. and That's not an easy feat to do. As with Band of Brothers there is a large cast here . But the main focus is on only a few soldiers . Not surprising as the source matériel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone. And the others caught in their orbit.Leckie's story is simply the story of a every man caught up in forces he can't control. the Horror and mind breaking conditions he faces as the war progresses almost kills him several times and yet he persists.Eugene sledge is the innocent young man 18 years old who wants to fight who wants to defend his country. And loses his innocence in the process. Sledge's story is the most emotional harrowing one here. Watching his story and the horrors he saw. Makes you wonder how he maintained his sanity. Sledge's friend Snafu is also a joy to watch as he helps Sledge maintain something of normality. In one scene when the new guys show up and snafu asks questions of them like their name sledge replies with a What Now you want to know their names . A common enough thing to happen during th war in which the seasoned vets did'not want to know the names of the new guys because they did not want to mourn them later on. The LAst main focus is Sgt. John Basilone a Marine who wins the medal of honor winner who wins it on Guladcanel after holding off a force of three thousand Japanese soldiers for three days . That story is vividly brought to life as well as his struggles in being a hero doing a War bond drive. and eventually returning to duty on Iwo Jima .The Pacific isn't perfect by any means . but in telling the story of the war. Its as good as it ever gets .","14 March 2010","8/10"

"The Pacific (2010)","""The Pacific"" is no ""Band of Brothers"" and it shouldn't be.","johnmcelroynu","I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn't have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men's paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone's reputation. As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life. Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn't much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek's portrayal of Merriel ""Snafu"" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn't think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.I wasn't as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can't make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men's hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it. One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won't say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it.","28 October 2011","6/10"

Not surprising as the source matériel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone.

And loses his innocence in the process. Sledge's story is the most emotional harrowing one here. Watching his story and the horrors he saw. Makes you wonder how he maintained his sanity. Sledge's friend Snafu is also a joy to watch as he helps Sledge maintain something of normality. In one scene when the new guys show up and snafu asks questions of them like their name sledge replies with a What Now you want to know their names . A common enough thing to happen during th war in which the seasoned vets did'not want to know the names of the new guys because they did not want to mourn them later on. The LAst main focus is Sgt. John Basilone a Marine who wins the medal of honor winner who wins it on Guladcanel after holding off a force of three thousand Japanese soldiers for three days . That story is vividly brought to life as well as his struggles in being a hero doing a War bond drive. and eventually returning to duty on Iwo Jima .The Pacific isn't perfect by any means . but in telling the story of the war.

"The Pacific (2010)","Left Me Devastated","gogoschka-1","I'm guessing most of us watched 'The Pacific' for at least one of the following 3 reasons:1. We have an interest in history, particularly in WW2.2. We are fans of movies and television shows (well, the good ones anyway)3. We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10.

"The Pacific (2010)","This story is finally told in the right way","follis12","The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.The US Marines in the Pacific lived like animals in the most horrible environments imaginable. On top of fighting an enemy committed to kill them at all cost and never surrender, they battled the mud, heat, malaria, near starvation, and isolation for months on end.Basically, it was a total nightmare, and the heroism of all the US Marines in the Pacific theater is nothing short of awe inspiring. The Pacific tells this story well. It is a must see on the topic of WW2.","10 July 2014","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Different from Band of Brothers","SnoopyStyle","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series. This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series. Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it.","28 May 2010","9/10"

It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10.

"The Pacific (2010)","This story is finally told in the right way","follis12","The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.The US Marines in the Pacific lived like animals in the most horrible environments imaginable. On top of fighting an enemy committed to kill them at all cost and never surrender, they battled the mud, heat, malaria, near starvation, and isolation for months on end.Basically, it was a total nightmare, and the heroism of all the US Marines in the Pacific theater is nothing short of awe inspiring. The Pacific tells this story well. It is a must see on the topic of WW2.","10 July 2014","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Different from Band of Brothers","SnoopyStyle","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series. This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series. Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it.","28 May 2010","9/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","This is a brutal, epic, gripping and Incredibly acted series that shows the true horror war brings","lbabe29","The Pacific miniseries will leave many of you in a state of awe. What a cinematic achievement. The best of the best of what American entertainment has to offer. The scenes and emotions portrayed are so vivid and lifelike that you'll think you've been transported back in time to the pacific theater of war. History has told us how horrid the war against the Japanese was. A war of attrition. This series will take you there and slap you on the wrists and then the face and remind you of the truth. War is utter diabolical hell. And the guys that fought in the pacific during WW2 were tough as nails. Tougher. It's ugly and beautiful at the same time. Enjoy and take a history lesson.

"The Pacific (2010)","Gripping and Powerful","janoffpeter","Well, it is no where as good as Band of Brothers, but the focus is too different. It doesn't stay on a single company and because of that, you kind of don't get what you expected......and what you expected is Band of Brothers in the Pacific theater and, well, without the same company to follow through the war, it doesn't give you that feel of brotherhood that made Band of Brothers so loved.However, you do get a sense of how brutal it was, much more so than the European theater. And that is another source of complaints. People thought it was carnage candy when, the Pacific was actually just carnage.So, really, its a misunderstood cousin.","9 February 2019","10/10"

"The Pacific (2010)","If you came across this series and you're thinking about watching it. PLEASE DO !!","zahra-michael","If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO's critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers"", change the channel""The Pacific"" differs from ""Band of Brothers"" whereas the ""The Pacific"" focuses on the war itself and ""Band of Brothers"" focused on the characters. Both miniseries are championed by Hollywood heavy-hitters Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who were contributing writers and producers of both miniseries.Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. It is clear that the soldiers in the Pacific theater fought a different kind of war than those fighting in Europe. ""The Pacific"" is a gritty if not gory depiction of a war against not just the Japanese, but also the elements. The cast is made-up of some brilliant actors we are sure to see again in future projects. What makes ""The Pacific"" so good is the intense realism which brings the viewer into the battle from the safety of your couch. If there is hell on earth, you will find it here.The army they are fighting is alien; both mysterious and ferocious. They are looked at with both awe and disdain and the Americans want to kill them all. However, there is a palpable sense fear among the men that this enemy will never surrender and will fight beyond what they feel is humanly if not morally possible. When one character hears about the Kamikaze's flying their planes into ships, he asks aloud ""how can any man do that?"" ""The Pacific"" is fast-paced and each episode leaves the viewer wanting more. What lacks in the series is the intimacy of knowing the characters. They are kept at a distance almost as if the character doesn't want to let you in. This may be the intent of the writers; just as the soldiers took little interest in knowing each other, maybe we are not meant to know the characters.","10 May 2010","8/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","""The Pacific"" is no ""Band of Brothers"" and it shouldn't be.","johnmcelroynu","I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn't have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men's paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone's reputation. As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life. Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn't much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek's portrayal of Merriel ""Snafu"" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn't think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.I wasn't as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can't make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men's hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it. One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won't say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it.","28 October 2011","6/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Great - once it gets going","Leofwine_draca","Rating: 7/10Themes: World War II, History, Drama, Action, Marines, Americans vs. Japanese, Trauma & Relationships.Review: The premise of this show had the potential for a gut-wrenching story filled with heart and grief, but it didn't manage to fully live up to that potential for me. This series definitely succeeded in showing the violence and hopelessness that went with being at war, but I struggled a little bit with the emotional factor. It lacked some depth for me there, and I was expecting more from it. The pacing was a little off as well and the structure wasn't the best. I have to say I thought the series did get better over time, and the first half truly felt different from the second half. In any case, this was an interesting watch, but it could have been more.","24 November 2010","9/10"
"The Pacific (2010)","Great job on a monumental task","noelani54","The Pacific does for the War in the Pacific theater. What Band of Brothers did for the European theater. It makes it more realistic. More understanding. and That's not an easy feat to do. As with Band of Brothers there is a large cast here . But the main focus is on only a few soldiers . Not surprising as the source matériel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone. And the others caught in their orbit.Leckie's story is simply the story of a every man caught up in forces he can't control. the Horror and mind breaking conditions he faces as the war progresses almost kills him several times and yet he persists.Eugene sledge is the innocent young man 18 years old who wants to fight who wants to defend his country. And loses his innocence in the process. Sledge's story is the most emotional harrowing one here. Watching his story and the horrors he saw. Makes you wonder how he maintained his sanity. Sledge's friend Snafu is also a joy to watch as he helps Sledge maintain something of normality. In one scene when the new guys show up and snafu asks questions of them like their name sledge replies with a What Now you want to know their names . A common enough thing to happen during th war in which the seasoned vets did'not want to know the names of the new guys because they did not want to mourn them later on. The LAst main focus is Sgt. John Basilone a Marine who wins the medal of honor winner who wins it on Guladcanel after holding off a force of three thousand Japanese soldiers for three days . That story is vividly brought to life as well as his struggles in being a hero doing a War bond drive. and eventually returning to duty on Iwo Jima .The Pacific isn't perfect by any means . but in telling the story of the war. Its as good as it ever gets .","14 March 2010","8/10"

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

"True Detective (2014)","Season one is brilliant!","DiCaprioFan1","The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2).","6 February 2023","9/10"
"True Detective (2014)","Season 1 is as close to perfect as you can get","ksgillihan","Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough.","13 January 2014","10/10"
"True Detective (2014)","Dark, brooding cinema - outstanding, but probably not for action fans","gogoschka-1","Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","10 August 2015","10/10"
"True Detective (2014)","Great first season, but lacklustre since then","grantss","(Review updated after Season 4).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. E.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season 4 is easily the worst season of the lot. After Seasons 2 and 3 were so lacklustre I was hesitant to watch it. However, the plot seemed interesting so I gave it a go. Initially the plot was intriguing and the setting - Alaska during days with 24 hours of night - made for a great backdrop that should have created a great atmosphere. This initial watchability was short-lived, however: the season reached its highpoint about 20 minutes in and then went continuously downhill from there.All the potential shown in the first 20 minutes is wasted as for the next five episodes all we largely have is pointless domestic stuff and other empty filler. The mystery, despite being the reason everyone watched the show, seems to take a backseat. Even when things do progress on that front it's in implausible, random, style-over-substance ways. The ending is particularly disappointing - I'd rather not have known what happened and who did it as the plot is incredibly weak, to the point of being laughable.Hopefully this is the final season as everything that has happened after Season 1 just brings down the True Detective brand.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10, S4 - 4/10.","4 January 2019","6/10"

"True Detective (2014)","Thoughts on Season One","Tweekums","This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance.","20 July 2022","10/10"

"True Detective (2014)","Perfection","loganschainker","True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived.

Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023.

"True Detective (2014)","Dark, brooding cinema - outstanding, but probably not for action fans","gogoschka-1","Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","10 August 2015","10/10"
"True Detective (2014)","Great first season, but lacklustre since then","grantss","(Review updated after Season 4).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. E.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season 4 is easily the worst season of the lot. After Seasons 2 and 3 were so lacklustre I was hesitant to watch it. However, the plot seemed interesting so I gave it a go. Initially the plot was intriguing and the setting - Alaska during days with 24 hours of night - made for a great backdrop that should have created a great atmosphere. This initial watchability was short-lived, however: the season reached its highpoint about 20 minutes in and then went continuously downhill from there.All the potential shown in the first 20 minutes is wasted as for the next five episodes all we largely have is pointless domestic stuff and other empty filler. The mystery, despite being the reason everyone watched the show, seems to take a backseat. Even when things do progress on that front it's in implausible, random, style-over-substance ways. The ending is particularly disappointing - I'd rather not have known what happened and who did it as the plot is incredibly weak, to the point of being laughable.Hopefully this is the final season as everything that has happened after Season 1 just brings down the True Detective brand.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10, S4 - 4/10.","4 January 2019","6/10"

"True Detective (2014)","Thoughts on Season One","Tweekums","This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance.","20 July 2022","10/10"

The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","10 August 2015","10/10"
"True Detective (2014)","Great first season, but lacklustre since then","grantss","(Review updated after Season 4).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. E.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season 4 is easily the worst season of the lot. After Seasons 2 and 3 were so lacklustre I was hesitant to watch it. However, the plot seemed interesting so I gave it a go. Initially the plot was intriguing and the setting - Alaska during days with 24 hours of night - made for a great backdrop that should have created a great atmosphere. This initial watchability was short-lived, however: the season reached its highpoint about 20 minutes in and then went continuously downhill from there.All the potential shown in the first 20 minutes is wasted as for the next five episodes all we largely have is pointless domestic stuff and other empty filler. The mystery, despite being the reason everyone watched the show, seems to take a backseat. Even when things do progress on that front it's in implausible, random, style-over-substance ways. The ending is particularly disappointing - I'd rather not have known what happened and who did it as the plot is incredibly weak, to the point of being laughable.Hopefully this is the final season as everything that has happened after Season 1 just brings down the True Detective brand.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10, S4 - 4/10.","4 January 2019","6/10"

"True Detective (2014)","Thoughts on Season One","Tweekums","This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance.","20 July 2022","10/10"

"True Detective (2014)","Perfection","loganschainker","True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall.

Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023.

The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough.","13 January 2014","10/10"

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Godlike","southdavid","I've written individual reviews for each season of ""Fleabag"" but as it's becoming apparent that any more is unlikely, I thought I'd post a composite of the two reviews here, to give an appraisal of the whole run.I'd been putting of ""Fleabag"" for a while, trying to let the weight of expectation die down a little, given how critically adored it is. However, the first season really lived up to its reputation as a clever, witty comedy.Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a hedonistic young woman whose fractured relationships with her family have been caused by her inability to cope with the deaths of both her mother, and more recently her best friend. The café they co-owned is struggling and her relationship seems to have come to a permanent end. She struggles to make valid connections with anyone except us, the audience.What can I say other than the show lived up to its reputation. It's funny, clever and vulgar at the same time. Fleabag is a great character, wonderfully played by Waller-Bridge and the rest of the cast a similarly excellent too, particularly Bill Paterson as her father and Olivia Colman as her wicked god/stepmum. Even though I really liked the first run, I wasn't prepared for just how much of a step up the second season would be. It's genuinely, one of the funniest, most enjoyable seasons of comedy I've seen in a long while. There's one immediate and obvious reason for the season two improvement. In the first episodes, any love interest for Fleabag wasn't a match for her wit or temperament, they were a punchline. Here Andrew Scott's ""Hot Priest"" is a fully rounded character, with his own issues and can both punch back and enjoy sparring with her. . It's just funnier all round though, even better written, more moving and, as it appears at the moment that this is all we're ever going to get, tinged with a bittersweet sadness - particularly in the final moments.Just glorious, wonderful TV.","20 March 2019","9/10"

Season 2 has hit the ground running and I am hanging on for every episode. Do yourselves a favour and binge this. Thanks to all involved with the production of this series.","26 August 2020","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Special sort of humor required!","elbandito1250","I watched the first episode together with my wife and she hated it from the beginning, while I instantly loved it! This special sort of humor is always highly divisive. Either you love it or you hate it. In my experience for shows like Fleabag there's no such ratings like ""quite entertaining and funny at times""! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is incredibly talented in so many ways, I can't tell what's more adorable about her work in Fleabag: the acting, the uncommon storytelling, the firework of weird gags...? Everything is fresh and unique. I really hope there's much more coming from her in the future, both as actress and as writer!","13 February 2022","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Very funny","grantss","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.Can't fault the casting nor performances. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is excellent in the lead role and the other major characters are superbly played.","9 September 2016","8/10"

She is totally bizarre, as are the entire supporting cast, and they won't allow you to stop laughing.If they can keep up the energy levels of the first two episodes, they will have a major hit on their hands.I had such a good time watching this, and I can't wait for the next episode.Don't pass this by.

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Utterly brilliant performance and writing from Phoebe Waller-Bridge","cherold","When I watched the first episode of Fleabag, I thought it was very funny but at the same time thought the main character was a bit off putting. But don't worry, her awfulness is mainly show.When I got around to watching the second episode, which was even funnier, I was hooked, and binge-watched the rest.Phoebe Waller-Bridge gives an amazing performance. She has a wonderfully expressive face which she uses to communicate with the audience, who she treats as a friend she's sharing secrets with. She can say everything with just a wry look or a moment of surprise.While Fleabag can seem like a sex-obsessed sitcom, the series insistently adds complexity to its characters. The main character is funny and bawdy, but also haunted by the death of a friend and traumatized by her upbringing. Her sister at first seems like a stock antagonist, but their relationship turns out to be far more nuanced, and the actresses' chemistry is remarkable. Even a bit part early on is given a chance at redemption.This is the first I've heard of Waller-Bridge, but she is an incredible talent. I just learned she made another series this year called Crashing, so I know what I'm watching next! (Update: I watched it, it was great)","30 May 2021","10/10"

I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved.

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","An anarchistic breathe of fresh air.","MovieFan-91319","I thought this show was so good I emailed BBC3 to thank them for airing it, and decided to write my first IMDb review. I thought it would be a comedy going in, and it did really make me laugh at times, but it turned out to be something very different. Some of, if not THE best storytelling i've ever seen in series format. I won't say anything else because I loved how it quietly surprised me. I suspect this show might not be for everyone (I struggle to elaborate on that) but give it a go, a couple of episodes in and I was completely absorbed in this dysfunctional human tale.Every part of this TV shows production was so well done. Fantastic acting, editing, photography if that's the right word. I really can't think of anything else like it off the top of my head.. so I would suggest watching it based on that alone and will be interested to see what the IMDb algorithm suggests people might also like in time. As it is I don't think any of the suggestions are remotely comparable. You really will miss out if you pass over this one, and at just two episodes you'll know what it's about. You won't be disappointed by the ending if you choose to keep going. It was SO well done. Everyone involved should be so proud.","27 August 2016","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Godlike","southdavid","I've written individual reviews for each season of ""Fleabag"" but as it's becoming apparent that any more is unlikely, I thought I'd post a composite of the two reviews here, to give an appraisal of the whole run.I'd been putting of ""Fleabag"" for a while, trying to let the weight of expectation die down a little, given how critically adored it is. However, the first season really lived up to its reputation as a clever, witty comedy.Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a hedonistic young woman whose fractured relationships with her family have been caused by her inability to cope with the deaths of both her mother, and more recently her best friend. The café they co-owned is struggling and her relationship seems to have come to a permanent end. She struggles to make valid connections with anyone except us, the audience.What can I say other than the show lived up to its reputation. It's funny, clever and vulgar at the same time. Fleabag is a great character, wonderfully played by Waller-Bridge and the rest of the cast a similarly excellent too, particularly Bill Paterson as her father and Olivia Colman as her wicked god/stepmum. Even though I really liked the first run, I wasn't prepared for just how much of a step up the second season would be. It's genuinely, one of the funniest, most enjoyable seasons of comedy I've seen in a long while. There's one immediate and obvious reason for the season two improvement. In the first episodes, any love interest for Fleabag wasn't a match for her wit or temperament, they were a punchline. Here Andrew Scott's ""Hot Priest"" is a fully rounded character, with his own issues and can both punch back and enjoy sparring with her. . It's just funnier all round though, even better written, more moving and, as it appears at the moment that this is all we're ever going to get, tinged with a bittersweet sadness - particularly in the final moments.Just glorious, wonderful TV.","20 March 2019","9/10"

In my experience for shows like Fleabag there's no such ratings like ""quite entertaining and funny at times""! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is incredibly talented in so many ways, I can't tell what's more adorable about her work in Fleabag: the acting, the uncommon storytelling, the firework of weird gags...?

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Very funny","grantss","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.Can't fault the casting nor performances.

She has a wonderfully expressive face which she uses to communicate with the audience, who she treats as a friend she's sharing secrets with. She can say everything with just a wry look or a moment of surprise.While Fleabag can seem like a sex-obsessed sitcom, the series insistently adds complexity to its characters. The main character is funny and bawdy, but also haunted by the death of a friend and traumatized by her upbringing. Her sister at first seems like a stock antagonist, but their relationship turns out to be far more nuanced, and the actresses' chemistry is remarkable. Even a bit part early on is given a chance at redemption.This is the first I've heard of Waller-Bridge, but she is an incredible talent.

I thought it would be a comedy going in, and it did really make me laugh at times, but it turned out to be something very different. Some of, if not THE best storytelling i've ever seen in series format. I won't say anything else because I loved how it quietly surprised me. I suspect this show might not be for everyone (I struggle to elaborate on that) but give it a go, a couple of episodes in and I was completely absorbed in this dysfunctional human tale.Every part of this TV shows production was so well done. Fantastic acting, editing, photography if that's the right word. I really can't think of anything else like it off the top of my head.. so I would suggest watching it based on that alone and will be interested to see what the IMDb algorithm suggests people might also like in time. As it is I don't think any of the suggestions are remotely comparable. You really will miss out if you pass over this one, and at just two episodes you'll know what it's about. You won't be disappointed by the ending if you choose to keep going. It was SO well done. Everyone involved should be so proud.","27 August 2016","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Godlike","southdavid","I've written individual reviews for each season of ""Fleabag"" but as it's becoming apparent that any more is unlikely, I thought I'd post a composite of the two reviews here, to give an appraisal of the whole run.I'd been putting of ""Fleabag"" for a while, trying to let the weight of expectation die down a little, given how critically adored it is. However, the first season really lived up to its reputation as a clever, witty comedy.Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a hedonistic young woman whose fractured relationships with her family have been caused by her inability to cope with the deaths of both her mother, and more recently her best friend. The café they co-owned is struggling and her relationship seems to have come to a permanent end. She struggles to make valid connections with anyone except us, the audience.What can I say other than the show lived up to its reputation. It's funny, clever and vulgar at the same time. Fleabag is a great character, wonderfully played by Waller-Bridge and the rest of the cast a similarly excellent too, particularly Bill Paterson as her father and Olivia Colman as her wicked god/stepmum. Even though I really liked the first run, I wasn't prepared for just how much of a step up the second season would be. It's genuinely, one of the funniest, most enjoyable seasons of comedy I've seen in a long while. There's one immediate and obvious reason for the season two improvement. In the first episodes, any love interest for Fleabag wasn't a match for her wit or temperament, they were a punchline. Here Andrew Scott's ""Hot Priest"" is a fully rounded character, with his own issues and can both punch back and enjoy sparring with her. . It's just funnier all round though, even better written, more moving and, as it appears at the moment that this is all we're ever going to get, tinged with a bittersweet sadness - particularly in the final moments.Just glorious, wonderful TV.","20 March 2019","9/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)",".............and you thought season 1 was funny.","Clipster12","Phoebe Waller-Bridge, I don't quite know how you do it dear but keep it up. As a 50 year old bloke this should be well off the mark for me but instead I find it by far the funniest, well observed and at times poignant thing on TV at the moment. Season 2 has hit the ground running and I am hanging on for every episode. Do yourselves a favour and binge this. Thanks to all involved with the production of this series.","26 August 2020","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Special sort of humor required!","elbandito1250","I watched the first episode together with my wife and she hated it from the beginning, while I instantly loved it! This special sort of humor is always highly divisive. Either you love it or you hate it. In my experience for shows like Fleabag there's no such ratings like ""quite entertaining and funny at times""! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is incredibly talented in so many ways, I can't tell what's more adorable about her work in Fleabag: the acting, the uncommon storytelling, the firework of weird gags...? Everything is fresh and unique. I really hope there's much more coming from her in the future, both as actress and as writer!","13 February 2022","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Very funny","grantss","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.Can't fault the casting nor performances. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is excellent in the lead role and the other major characters are superbly played.","9 September 2016","8/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Over the Top Funny","yossarian100","I've rarely seen anything this funny, and there it is....half an hour of non-stop laughter.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is hysterical as she constantly shares both her innermost and her totally superficial feelings with the audience, even while she's having sex. She is totally bizarre, as are the entire supporting cast, and they won't allow you to stop laughing.If they can keep up the energy levels of the first two episodes, they will have a major hit on their hands.I had such a good time watching this, and I can't wait for the next episode.Don't pass this by. It's one of the best shows TV has to offer.Enjoy!","5 April 2018","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","I am shocked! I really enjoyed it!","djg32514","Not my typical cup of tea. Watched an episode with no intent and before I knew it I was smiling. Then laughing. Phoebe has amazing comedic talent. Even an old guy like me can recognize her talent. Quirky, irreverent, intelligent humor. Not something in abundance here in the states.","26 January 2017","9/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Utterly brilliant performance and writing from Phoebe Waller-Bridge","cherold","When I watched the first episode of Fleabag, I thought it was very funny but at the same time thought the main character was a bit off putting. But don't worry, her awfulness is mainly show.When I got around to watching the second episode, which was even funnier, I was hooked, and binge-watched the rest.Phoebe Waller-Bridge gives an amazing performance. She has a wonderfully expressive face which she uses to communicate with the audience, who she treats as a friend she's sharing secrets with. She can say everything with just a wry look or a moment of surprise.While Fleabag can seem like a sex-obsessed sitcom, the series insistently adds complexity to its characters. The main character is funny and bawdy, but also haunted by the death of a friend and traumatized by her upbringing. Her sister at first seems like a stock antagonist, but their relationship turns out to be far more nuanced, and the actresses' chemistry is remarkable. Even a bit part early on is given a chance at redemption.This is the first I've heard of Waller-Bridge, but she is an incredible talent. I just learned she made another series this year called Crashing, so I know what I'm watching next! (Update: I watched it, it was great)","30 May 2021","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Quirky and heartbreaking","izabelab-08870","I'm still so annoyed with BBC3 for switching to online only, I still enjoy watching the show on my lunch break at work, but it doesn't beat watching it on the box.Fleabag is one of the best shows to come from BBC3 since the likes of Gary Tank Commander and Cuckoo. I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved. Olivia Colman can do no wrong, but it's nice to see her cast in a very different role, so often playing a 'sweet' character, she shows her versatility. Bill Patterson great also,","28 August 2016","10/10"
"Fleabag (2016–2019)","How good is this!!","Sleepin_Dragon","I never give 10 stars, since I'm personally dubious of all 10 star reviews.
But lately, American 'comedies' are so full of social justice and religious/political engineering, I almost forgot what it was like to laugh. Finding this show (just started season 2)--it's an anarchistic breathe of fresh air, compared to the group-think slop being shoveled into our troughs here in the US.

But I think the combinaton of well established stars (Reilly, Brody, Clarke) and the least known ones did work. I really like Quincy Isaiah acting as Magic, it's perfect. The different pace between first and second season might be confusing but it's not a major flaw. The cinematography is also very good and it fits the narrative of the show. It's Lakers, 1980's Lakers, the showtime.Again, I'm still annoyed with the show cancellation. I thought there could be more saucy stories or plots to be developed in the following seasons.","9 May 2022","8/10"
"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty (2022–2023)","An entertaining show but...","schappe1","I've now watched all ten episodes of what will now be the first season and was wonderfully entertained by this audacious, fast-paced show. I love the scenes where Jerry Buss addresses the audience and was sorry that there were fewer of them after the amazing opener. The cast is wonderful. John C. Reilly is perfect as the ever-smiling but often troubled Dr. Jerry Buss, (I doubt Will Ferrell would have been as good). Sally Field is wonderful as his mother and Hadley Robinson as his under- appreciated daughter, Jeannie, (who now owns the team), and Gabby Hoffman as Buss' chief assistant are also excellent. Quincy Isaiah and Solomon Hughes both look and act like Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The coaches, Tracy Letts as Jack McKinney, Jason Segal as Paul Westhead and Adrien Brody as Pat Reilly, all do a good job and the many other roles seem well-cast.I'd give the show a '10' except for the portrayal of Jerry West, which has bene heavily criticized by everyone who knew Jerry and by Jerry himself, who appears to be ready to sue the producers. I've only seen Jerry West on TV but he always seemed like a polite southern gentleman. That he would have to be more than that to be the competitor he was is not surprising. I've read that he had a lot of inner turmoil but not that he was the temperamental, profane, self-involved jerk we see here. It made me wonder how much of what we see in this series is true and how much of it is not. There's such a thing as literary license and that may be necessary to turn the cacophony of life into a story but that doesn't excuse character assassination.I also question the characterization of Paul Westhead as a weakling who doesn't realize that he's going to have to argue with the referees. Westhead had been the head coach at LaSalle for 9 years before this and had successful teams there. That's not the NBA but Westhead shouldn't have been that far over his head coaching the Lakers. He'd never been an assistant to Jack McKinney before the 1979-80 season yet he's depicted as a long-time McKinney loyalist who is told by Jack that McKinney hired him because he knew that Westhead would never be a threat to his job or to leave for another. This just doesn't seem right.Postscript: They have now cancelled this show after the second season, which finished with a summary of what happened in subsequent seasons. Thus, the show dramatizes only half of the Laker's dynasty and none of the post dynasty era where Magic acquired HIV, (the subject of the first scene in the premiere) and lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls in Magic's last finals appearance. This is hugely disappointing, but I suppose that it was an expensive show to produce and since the ratings were down, I guess they felt they had no choice. It thus ends with a Celtics Victory. I'll bet Red Auerbach is puffing on his cigar, wherever he is now.","9 March 2022","8/10"

We then go to the ""Playboy Mansion Los Angeles, 1979"" as we are introduced to real estate developer Jerry Buss, who has set his sights on buying the LA Lakers from then-owner Jack Kent Cooke, among rumors that the NBA is not doing well and ""might not exist in five years"". At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this series is the brainchild of Max Borenstein (writer of several ""Godzilla"" movies), with Andy McKay (yes, THE Andy McKay, of ""Don't Look Up"" and ""The Big Short"") serving as Executive Producer and also directing Episode 1 for good measure. In fact, having seen the initial 2 episodes to date, this mini-series has the McKay vibe all over it, including character talking directly to the audience, grainy photography (to recreate the 80s vibe), etc. Episode 1 deals primarily with the purchase of the franchise by Jerry Buss. Episode 2 deals primarily with Jerry West's continued and fierce resistance to Magic Johnson. Along the way we get exposed to some of the relics of those times, including ugly scenes of blatant bigotry and racism for the 'good ol' (white) boys' like Jack Kent Cooke, ugh. This mini-series features an all-star cast, with John C. Reilly seemingly having the time of his life as Jerry Buss, but many others such as Jason Clark (as Jerry West), and Adrien Brody and Sally Field (who have yet to appear). Bottom line: this is a rollicking look back to the 1980s when the NBA really starting coming into its own, carried by the Lakers-Celtics rivalry, personified in the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry. Just sit back and relax: Showtime is here!""Winning Time"" premiered premiered in early March on HBO and once episodes have aired, they are available on HBO On Demand and HBO Max (where I caught it).

The different pace between first and second season might be confusing but it's not a major flaw. The cinematography is also very good and it fits the narrative of the show.

"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty (2022–2023)","An entertaining show but...","schappe1","I've now watched all ten episodes of what will now be the first season and was wonderfully entertained by this audacious, fast-paced show. I love the scenes where Jerry Buss addresses the audience and was sorry that there were fewer of them after the amazing opener. The cast is wonderful. John C. Reilly is perfect as the ever-smiling but often troubled Dr. Jerry Buss, (I doubt Will Ferrell would have been as good). Sally Field is wonderful as his mother and Hadley Robinson as his under- appreciated daughter, Jeannie, (who now owns the team), and Gabby Hoffman as Buss' chief assistant are also excellent. Quincy Isaiah and Solomon Hughes both look and act like Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The coaches, Tracy Letts as Jack McKinney, Jason Segal as Paul Westhead and Adrien Brody as Pat Reilly, all do a good job and the many other roles seem well-cast.I'd give the show a '10' except for the portrayal of Jerry West, which has bene heavily criticized by everyone who knew Jerry and by Jerry himself, who appears to be ready to sue the producers. I've only seen Jerry West on TV but he always seemed like a polite southern gentleman. That he would have to be more than that to be the competitor he was is not surprising. I've read that he had a lot of inner turmoil but not that he was the temperamental, profane, self-involved jerk we see here. It made me wonder how much of what we see in this series is true and how much of it is not. There's such a thing as literary license and that may be necessary to turn the cacophony of life into a story but that doesn't excuse character assassination.I also question the characterization of Paul Westhead as a weakling who doesn't realize that he's going to have to argue with the referees. Westhead had been the head coach at LaSalle for 9 years before this and had successful teams there. That's not the NBA but Westhead shouldn't have been that far over his head coaching the Lakers. He'd never been an assistant to Jack McKinney before the 1979-80 season yet he's depicted as a long-time McKinney loyalist who is told by Jack that McKinney hired him because he knew that Westhead would never be a threat to his job or to leave for another. This just doesn't seem right.Postscript: They have now cancelled this show after the second season, which finished with a summary of what happened in subsequent seasons. Thus, the show dramatizes only half of the Laker's dynasty and none of the post dynasty era where Magic acquired HIV, (the subject of the first scene in the premiere) and lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls in Magic's last finals appearance. This is hugely disappointing, but I suppose that it was an expensive show to produce and since the ratings were down, I guess they felt they had no choice. It thus ends with a Celtics Victory. I'll bet Red Auerbach is puffing on his cigar, wherever he is now.","9 March 2022","8/10"

In fact, having seen the initial 2 episodes to date, this mini-series has the McKay vibe all over it, including character talking directly to the audience, grainy photography (to recreate the 80s vibe), etc. Episode 1 deals primarily with the purchase of the franchise by Jerry Buss.

We then go to the ""Playboy Mansion Los Angeles, 1979"" as we are introduced to real estate developer Jerry Buss, who has set his sights on buying the LA Lakers from then-owner Jack Kent Cooke, among rumors that the NBA is not doing well and ""might not exist in five years"". At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this series is the brainchild of Max Borenstein (writer of several ""Godzilla"" movies), with Andy McKay (yes, THE Andy McKay, of ""Don't Look Up"" and ""The Big Short"") serving as Executive Producer and also directing Episode 1 for good measure. In fact, having seen the initial 2 episodes to date, this mini-series has the McKay vibe all over it, including character talking directly to the audience, grainy photography (to recreate the 80s vibe), etc. Episode 1 deals primarily with the purchase of the franchise by Jerry Buss. Episode 2 deals primarily with Jerry West's continued and fierce resistance to Magic Johnson. Along the way we get exposed to some of the relics of those times, including ugly scenes of blatant bigotry and racism for the 'good ol' (white) boys' like Jack Kent Cooke, ugh. This mini-series features an all-star cast, with John C. Reilly seemingly having the time of his life as Jerry Buss, but many others such as Jason Clark (as Jerry West), and Adrien Brody and Sally Field (who have yet to appear). Bottom line: this is a rollicking look back to the 1980s when the NBA really starting coming into its own, carried by the Lakers-Celtics rivalry, personified in the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry. Just sit back and relax: Showtime is here!""Winning Time"" premiered premiered in early March on HBO and once episodes have aired, they are available on HBO On Demand and HBO Max (where I caught it). New episodes air on Sunday evenings. If you are an NBA fan, or simply have fond memories of the 1980s, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","14 March 2022","7/10"

John C Riley kills it!!I came into this with really no expectations at all.I wasn't excited and a bit skeptical.But so far I'm loving it.The guy who plays Jerry West really shines as well and somewhat hilarious.And breaking the fourth wall was a genius idea.10 times better than watching the lakers this season,

The depiction of jerry west is hysterical; I wouldn't be surprised if jerry has already sued the show. I never rooted for the Lakers though I always admired their style. This series takes you back to a time when sports was about competition and fun and not about slogans on the court.","8 March 2022","8/10"

"The Shawshank Redemption (1994)","An incredible movie. One that lives with you.","Sleepin_Dragon","I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.","21 November 2005","10/10"

It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.","25 March 1999","10/10"
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994)","The Shawshank Redemption","Coxer99","Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.","15 June 2018","10/10"

It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking.

"The Shawshank Redemption (1994)","The Shawshank Redemption","Coxer99","Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.","15 June 2018","10/10"

And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.","21 November 2005","10/10"

He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

"The Godfather (1972)","The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!","CalRhys","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","1 April 2019","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","andrewburgereviews","A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.","6 February 2021","10/10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.","21 June 2008","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","An Iconic Film","alexkolokotronis","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","5 March 2002","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Another kind of ""family movie""","b-a-h TNT-6","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","30 March 2013","10/10"

It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.","18 July 2010","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","TheLittleSongbird","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.","14 October 2006","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","mattrochman","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","1 April 2014","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!","CalRhys","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","1 April 2019","10/10"

The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","5 March 2002","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Another kind of ""family movie""","b-a-h TNT-6","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","30 March 2013","10/10"

"The Godfather (1972)","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","TheLittleSongbird","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.","14 October 2006","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","mattrochman","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","1 April 2014","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!","CalRhys","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.","1 April 2019","10/10"

After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.","21 June 2008","10/10"

Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox","5 March 2002","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Another kind of ""family movie""","b-a-h TNT-6","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.","30 March 2013","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","planktonrules","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.","18 July 2010","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","TheLittleSongbird","I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.","14 October 2006","10/10"
"The Godfather (1972)","Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","mattrochman","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.","1 April 2014","10/10"

Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins.""

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.

"Perfect Days","Make an effort to get on the film's level and it's quite wonderful","Jeremy_Urquhart","Yes, the movie about the guy cleaning toilets in Japan for two hours is up there among the best of 2023. I was worried it might be boring, but once the routine of the protagonist is established, there are gradually more dramatic elements revealed, and I feel like the whole film is about finding happiness or at least some level of contentment in the mundane. That gives it a similarity to Paterson, but I feel like it's really only the first half of Perfect Days that feels super comparable; there are added elements here in the second half that help the two feel different.Wim Wenders loves driving, he loves Japan, and he loves great music, and you get a lot of all three here. I think it's my favorite film of his besides the epic Until the End of the World (also partly set in Japan, also with much driving, and also with a killer soundtrack), but there are many films of his I should revisit, because I might've been too young for them when I did watch them (Paris, Texas comes to mind).If you're able to settle into a groove the same way the main character does here, I think Perfect Days ends up being surprisingly engrossing for most of its runtime. I was glad to see it in a cinema, and without any distractions. Parts of it also reminded me of Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, but that one's more provocative in highlighting boredom, and wants to wear the viewer down to make them feel the plight of the titular character. Perfect Days gives you 12 days (I counted) in the life of someone who has a profession that sounds boring, but captures small moments throughout nearly two weeks in this guy's life that show happiness and beauty with his lifestyle.I liked spending time with this character, I loved how the film looked and sounded music-wise, and I appreciated all the quiet yet touching moments; some of them funny, and some of them sad. I don't know if Perfect Days is for everyone, and it might not have even been for me, had I watched it on a different day or in different circumstances. But all I know is that it hit the spot today, and that's all that matters today. ""Now is now,"" as they say in the film itself.","13 July 2023","9/10"
"Perfect Days","Perfect Days: A Poetic Ode to Simplicity and Serenity","ergo-58534","Greetings again from the darkness. For most folks, life is a constant battle each and every day as we attempt to avoid the chaos stemming from work, health, friends, family, and overall stress. Sometimes we kid ourselves into thinking we have things under control, but inevitably, a sharp reminder pops up letting us know ""control"" is a mirage, and life is meant to be more rollercoaster than smooth sailing. Longtime writer-director Wim Wenders and co-writer Takuma Takasaki have teamed up for this Oscar nominated film depicting one man's attempt to control his life.Veteran actor Koji Yakusho stars as Hirayama. He's the proverbial creature of habit, which the first 45 minutes of the movie prove. We see him rise from sleep in his simple, well-organized apartment. He spritzes his plants, smiles at the sky, and drives his van to his job as a sanitation worker in the city. The logo on his jumpsuit is The Tokyo Toilet and we follow him on his rounds as he scrubs the public toilets ... each structure more artistic than the last. When he pauses for rest, Hirayama takes photos of trees with his camera. Taking pride in his work, this man of few words, has found serenity in his routine which includes nighttime reading (Faulkner, Koda, and even Patricia Highsmith). While driving his van, Hirayama utilizes his carefully selected collection of cassette tapes to provide the classic rock he loves (The Kinks, Lou Reed, etc).Generational and personality differences are apparent when contrasting Hirayama and his young assistant Takashi (Tokio Emoto). As the elder works towards a job well done, Takashi plays on his phone, flirts with a girl, a strives only for a job done so that he can move on to the more enjoyable evenings. The two are not friends, but the elder does seem to understand the desires and anxiousness of the younger man. At night, Hirayama does his reading and then dreams ... visions we see in black and white, many which seem to relate to nature's beauty of the trees he photographs each day.When one is so meticulous about the steps for each day, it takes little to shake his world. It could be the actions of his co-worker, a kiss on the cheek, a recurring homeless man in the park, and certainly, the arrival of his teenage niece after she runs away from home. When his sister arrives to take the girl back, we sense the strain in their relationship - something from the past that still lingers. It's these minor blips, along with an odd game of 'shadow tag' that shake Hirayama's routine and open him (back) up to life's ups and downs. At first, we believe Wenders is showing us the difference between alone and lonely, as this man seems quite content. But the final shot is of Hirayama's awakening and acceptance, or at least acknowledgment, of the emotions to be found in uncertainty. It's a wonderful film, beautifully directed, and expertly acted. ""Perfect Day"" by Lou Reed and ""Feeling Good"" by Nina Simone are two of the standout songs featured here.In theaters beginning February 7, 2024.","7 February 2024","10/10"
"Perfect Days","alone vs lonely vs awakened","ferguson-6","I saw it as a kind of poem about happiness in fair, simple terms , as refuge against high expectations and social pressure.I saw it, in same measure, as a sort of idealisation of life, moral lesson, fair portrait of lonely man.Not less, I saw it as portrait of me, sure, in basic terms, with large slices of desire to real be.But, out of this identification with Hirayama, Perfect Days has the gift to be a beautiful, admirable crafted, scene by scene, film. In essence, this is the real thing matters . A beautiful exploration by Wim Wenders of dreams of his audience , with some bovaric touch, about a life who was not him.","26 January 2024","8/10"
"Perfect Days","one thousand shades of loneliness","dromasca","It won't blow you away, but you will not leave empty-handed. For two weeks, we follow a Japanese toilet cleaner in Tokyo. Not much happens, but that is the beauty of it all. Hirayama, played by fantastic Koji Yakusho, does his job, listens to excellent music, reads books, and goes about his everyday, unexciting routine. It does not sound special, right? But it is.For Hirayama, the small, boring, and common things are beautiful. He stops for a moment and looks at the beautiful trees, which the rest of us walk past daily and never notice. When you leave the theaters, your walk home will be special. It's impossible to watch this movie without going outside and appreciating the small (but beautiful) things.","3 March 2024","9/10"
"Perfect Days","Hirayama","Kirpianuscus","I have never seen a more authentic movie. This movie does whatever the hell it pleases. It's not here to live up to any expectations or to serve a specific purpose; no, it's here because it feels like it wants to be here, and we are fortunate enough to be included in its existence.This film is about a man who truly lives in the moment without being some spiritual guru. He deals with whatever comes his way, the good, the bad and the ugly, and he welcomes it without words. That's because he doesn't need words. He doesn't need to analyze, remember or anticipate because ""now is now"". He accepts and embraces reality, finding joy in every little detail. But also not shying away from sorrow. But he never gets dramatic.And that's why this movie is so unique. There is no plot, there is no past full of hurt, there is no goal, there is no desire. Yet, it was mesmerizing, and I was glued to the screen. I was blown away. It's a movie that will stick with me for a long time.","12 January 2024","7/10"
"Perfect Days","Will not leave you empty-handed.","lovemichaeljordan","Just watched it in NYFF where it was received with standing ovation. Only Wim Wenders can create such a simple film without a narrative and make us glued for 2 hours. He tells the repetitive story of a public toilet cleaner at Tokyo as he goes thru his life during a 2 week period and it takes the form of a travel documentary. We can see a great blend of the pathos from Paris, Texas and the compassion from Wings of Desire. It also has an element of Jeanne Dielman as Hirayama goes thru his daily activities in a repetitive manner but with subtle deviations based on how other events unfold in his schedule.We get to know very little about his back story and how he ended up being a toilet cleaner. But we can form an opinion based on his choices in books, music and his interactions with his niece and his sister.I had the privilege of hearing Koji Yakusho live in a Q&A session after the movie and hear his perspectives.","20 December 2023","10/10"
"Perfect Days","Completely authentic","carmen163","The film starts slow, but that's the point. We start to know a dedicated Tokyo toilet cleaner who goes through his daily routine, apparently happy with his life. Then a series of minor events cause upheaval: his colleagues, family, and romantic interest remind him of life's missed opportunities. All very subtle reminders that you can be perfectly happy in a bland life following your daily routine, but that life's circumstances are forever changing, and are inviting and challenging you to lead life on a higher, more interesting level. The closing shot reveals a clearly emotional toilet cleaner driving to work: life's new opportunities have unsettled him. The open ending leaves us wondering what's next. A great movie that is largely carried by the phenomenal Koji Yashuko: he superbly carries the story with his facial expressions between the extremely sparse dialogues. The cinematography by Franz Lustig is also incredibly good: the closing scene, the loving lighting of the numerous toilets, etc. I'd rate it higher but the film is vaguely unsatisfying in its sublety: it generates the itch but just barely scratches it. But definitely one of the best films of 2023.","18 October 2023","9/10"
"Perfect Days","A love letter to the toilets of Tokyo","euroGary","Perfect Days is a good, relaxing experience. It teaches you a lot about life, but more than that it showed me that public toilets in Tokyo, Japan are the shiz. I mean, I'm comparing them with those back home in Mumbai, India, and it's just amazing to see such shiny, well-maintained, and usable public bathrooms. Once you stop admiring the toilets, you'll start admiring the obsessive interest in which our lead guy cleans them, day in and day out. And through that he shows how his perfect life is. Throughout the movie I would wait for him to start playing his cassette and anticipate what rock track he would play between his tasks and he didn't disappoint once. ""Respect sports teams and others' religions"" is another line that will stay with me. Perfect Days will stay with me because it's different, it's therapeutic, it's wholesome. Watch it.(Watched at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)","13 October 2023","10/10"
"Perfect Days","A meditative and poignant portrait from Wim Wenders","rakeshroy31","Years ago i took my friend's daughter to see a movie adaptation of 'the secret garden' because i wanted to share a book i had loved as a child. When my mom asked what she thought of the movie, her response was 'mostly... it was about a garden.'
well, 'perfect days' is mostly about a man who cleans toilets - albeit with extreme efficiency and thoroughness. He has a simple, well-ordered existence that follows a comfortable routine until people start inserting themselves into his life.This is not an action-packed bombastic story, but you may find yourself thinking about your own life and envying someone who greets each new day with a smile.

"Perfect Days","About a happy toilet cleaner who discovers change.","mentemalleo","It's a movie about mundane life, in different ways. While watching this movie you might think, where is this story going? Is something happening? Will his routine fall apart? Is he meeting someone? Maybe, maybe not...The story will make you conscious about simple things in your daily life. Those activities can be happy, a little sad or unexpected. It's all about your own perception.Overall, this movie was relaxing to experience and eye-opening in an interesting way. When I walked out of the cinema and looked around it made me feel very privileged about life. Every person experiences satisfactions in their own way. If you are a homeless, disabled, a CEO, a toiler-cleaner, happiness finds its way.","27 October 2023","7/10"

A great movie that is largely carried by the phenomenal Koji Yashuko: he superbly carries the story with his facial expressions between the extremely sparse dialogues. The cinematography by Franz Lustig is also incredibly good: the closing scene, the loving lighting of the numerous toilets, etc. I'd rate it higher but the film is vaguely unsatisfying in its sublety: it generates the itch but just barely scratches it.

"Perfect Days","A love letter to the toilets of Tokyo","euroGary","Perfect Days is a good, relaxing experience. It teaches you a lot about life, but more than that it showed me that public toilets in Tokyo, Japan are the shiz. I mean, I'm comparing them with those back home in Mumbai, India, and it's just amazing to see such shiny, well-maintained, and usable public bathrooms. Once you stop admiring the toilets, you'll start admiring the obsessive interest in which our lead guy cleans them, day in and day out. And through that he shows how his perfect life is. Throughout the movie I would wait for him to start playing his cassette and anticipate what rock track he would play between his tasks and he didn't disappoint once. ""Respect sports teams and others' religions"" is another line that will stay with me. Perfect Days will stay with me because it's different, it's therapeutic, it's wholesome.

well, 'perfect days' is mostly about a man who cleans toilets - albeit with extreme efficiency and thoroughness. He has a simple, well-ordered existence that follows a comfortable routine until people start inserting themselves into his life.This is not an action-packed bombastic story, but you may find yourself thinking about your own life and envying someone who greets each new day with a smile.

While watching this movie you might think, where is this story going? Is something happening? Will his routine fall apart? Is he meeting someone? Maybe, maybe not...The story will make you conscious about simple things in your daily life. Those activities can be happy, a little sad or unexpected. It's all about your own perception.Overall, this movie was relaxing to experience and eye-opening in an interesting way. When I walked out of the cinema and looked around it made me feel very privileged about life. Every person experiences satisfactions in their own way. If you are a homeless, disabled, a CEO, a toiler-cleaner, happiness finds its way.","27 October 2023","7/10"
"Perfect Days","Make an effort to get on the film's level and it's quite wonderful","Jeremy_Urquhart","Yes, the movie about the guy cleaning toilets in Japan for two hours is up there among the best of 2023. I was worried it might be boring, but once the routine of the protagonist is established, there are gradually more dramatic elements revealed, and I feel like the whole film is about finding happiness or at least some level of contentment in the mundane. That gives it a similarity to Paterson, but I feel like it's really only the first half of Perfect Days that feels super comparable; there are added elements here in the second half that help the two feel different.Wim Wenders loves driving, he loves Japan, and he loves great music, and you get a lot of all three here. I think it's my favorite film of his besides the epic Until the End of the World (also partly set in Japan, also with much driving, and also with a killer soundtrack), but there are many films of his I should revisit, because I might've been too young for them when I did watch them (Paris, Texas comes to mind).If you're able to settle into a groove the same way the main character does here, I think Perfect Days ends up being surprisingly engrossing for most of its runtime. I was glad to see it in a cinema, and without any distractions. Parts of it also reminded me of Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, but that one's more provocative in highlighting boredom, and wants to wear the viewer down to make them feel the plight of the titular character. Perfect Days gives you 12 days (I counted) in the life of someone who has a profession that sounds boring, but captures small moments throughout nearly two weeks in this guy's life that show happiness and beauty with his lifestyle.I liked spending time with this character, I loved how the film looked and sounded music-wise, and I appreciated all the quiet yet touching moments; some of them funny, and some of them sad.

The closing shot reveals a clearly emotional toilet cleaner driving to work: life's new opportunities have unsettled him. The open ending leaves us wondering what's next. A great movie that is largely carried by the phenomenal Koji Yashuko: he superbly carries the story with his facial expressions between the extremely sparse dialogues. The cinematography by Franz Lustig is also incredibly good: the closing scene, the loving lighting of the numerous toilets, etc. I'd rate it higher but the film is vaguely unsatisfying in its sublety: it generates the itch but just barely scratches it. But definitely one of the best films of 2023.","18 October 2023","9/10"
"Perfect Days","A love letter to the toilets of Tokyo","euroGary","Perfect Days is a good, relaxing experience. It teaches you a lot about life, but more than that it showed me that public toilets in Tokyo, Japan are the shiz. I mean, I'm comparing them with those back home in Mumbai, India, and it's just amazing to see such shiny, well-maintained, and usable public bathrooms. Once you stop admiring the toilets, you'll start admiring the obsessive interest in which our lead guy cleans them, day in and day out. And through that he shows how his perfect life is. Throughout the movie I would wait for him to start playing his cassette and anticipate what rock track he would play between his tasks and he didn't disappoint once.

While watching this movie you might think, where is this story going? Is something happening? Will his routine fall apart? Is he meeting someone?

"Perfect Days","Make an effort to get on the film's level and it's quite wonderful","Jeremy_Urquhart","Yes, the movie about the guy cleaning toilets in Japan for two hours is up there among the best of 2023. I was worried it might be boring, but once the routine of the protagonist is established, there are gradually more dramatic elements revealed, and I feel like the whole film is about finding happiness or at least some level of contentment in the mundane. That gives it a similarity to Paterson, but I feel like it's really only the first half of Perfect Days that feels super comparable; there are added elements here in the second half that help the two feel different.Wim Wenders loves driving, he loves Japan, and he loves great music, and you get a lot of all three here. I think it's my favorite film of his besides the epic Until the End of the World (also partly set in Japan, also with much driving, and also with a killer soundtrack), but there are many films of his I should revisit, because I might've been too young for them when I did watch them (Paris, Texas comes to mind).If you're able to settle into a groove the same way the main character does here, I think Perfect Days ends up being surprisingly engrossing for most of its runtime. I was glad to see it in a cinema, and without any distractions. Parts of it also reminded me of Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, but that one's more provocative in highlighting boredom, and wants to wear the viewer down to make them feel the plight of the titular character. Perfect Days gives you 12 days (I counted) in the life of someone who has a profession that sounds boring, but captures small moments throughout nearly two weeks in this guy's life that show happiness and beauty with his lifestyle.I liked spending time with this character, I loved how the film looked and sounded music-wise, and I appreciated all the quiet yet touching moments; some of them funny, and some of them sad. I don't know if Perfect Days is for everyone, and it might not have even been for me, had I watched it on a different day or in different circumstances. But all I know is that it hit the spot today, and that's all that matters today. ""Now is now,"" as they say in the film itself.","13 July 2023","9/10"
"Perfect Days","Perfect Days: A Poetic Ode to Simplicity and Serenity","ergo-58534","Greetings again from the darkness. For most folks, life is a constant battle each and every day as we attempt to avoid the chaos stemming from work, health, friends, family, and overall stress. Sometimes we kid ourselves into thinking we have things under control, but inevitably, a sharp reminder pops up letting us know ""control"" is a mirage, and life is meant to be more rollercoaster than smooth sailing. Longtime writer-director Wim Wenders and co-writer Takuma Takasaki have teamed up for this Oscar nominated film depicting one man's attempt to control his life.Veteran actor Koji Yakusho stars as Hirayama. He's the proverbial creature of habit, which the first 45 minutes of the movie prove. We see him rise from sleep in his simple, well-organized apartment. He spritzes his plants, smiles at the sky, and drives his van to his job as a sanitation worker in the city. The logo on his jumpsuit is The Tokyo Toilet and we follow him on his rounds as he scrubs the public toilets ... each structure more artistic than the last. When he pauses for rest, Hirayama takes photos of trees with his camera. Taking pride in his work, this man of few words, has found serenity in his routine which includes nighttime reading (Faulkner, Koda, and even Patricia Highsmith). While driving his van, Hirayama utilizes his carefully selected collection of cassette tapes to provide the classic rock he loves (The Kinks, Lou Reed, etc).Generational and personality differences are apparent when contrasting Hirayama and his young assistant Takashi (Tokio Emoto). As the elder works towards a job well done, Takashi plays on his phone, flirts with a girl, a strives only for a job done so that he can move on to the more enjoyable evenings. The two are not friends, but the elder does seem to understand the desires and anxiousness of the younger man. At night, Hirayama does his reading and then dreams ... visions we see in black and white, many which seem to relate to nature's beauty of the trees he photographs each day.When one is so meticulous about the steps for each day, it takes little to shake his world. It could be the actions of his co-worker, a kiss on the cheek, a recurring homeless man in the park, and certainly, the arrival of his teenage niece after she runs away from home. When his sister arrives to take the girl back, we sense the strain in their relationship - something from the past that still lingers. It's these minor blips, along with an odd game of 'shadow tag' that shake Hirayama's routine and open him (back) up to life's ups and downs. At first, we believe Wenders is showing us the difference between alone and lonely, as this man seems quite content. But the final shot is of Hirayama's awakening and acceptance, or at least acknowledgment, of the emotions to be found in uncertainty. It's a wonderful film, beautifully directed, and expertly acted. ""Perfect Day"" by Lou Reed and ""Feeling Good"" by Nina Simone are two of the standout songs featured here.In theaters beginning February 7, 2024.","7 February 2024","10/10"
"Perfect Days","alone vs lonely vs awakened","ferguson-6","I saw it as a kind of poem about happiness in fair, simple terms , as refuge against high expectations and social pressure.I saw it, in same measure, as a sort of idealisation of life, moral lesson, fair portrait of lonely man.Not less, I saw it as portrait of me, sure, in basic terms, with large slices of desire to real be.But, out of this identification with Hirayama, Perfect Days has the gift to be a beautiful, admirable crafted, scene by scene, film. In essence, this is the real thing matters . A beautiful exploration by Wim Wenders of dreams of his audience , with some bovaric touch, about a life who was not him.","26 January 2024","8/10"

It does not sound special, right? But it is.For Hirayama, the small, boring, and common things are beautiful. He stops for a moment and looks at the beautiful trees, which the rest of us walk past daily and never notice. When you leave the theaters, your walk home will be special. It's impossible to watch this movie without going outside and appreciating the small (but beautiful) things.","3 March 2024","9/10"
"Perfect Days","Hirayama","Kirpianuscus","I have never seen a more authentic movie. This movie does whatever the hell it pleases. It's not here to live up to any expectations or to serve a specific purpose; no, it's here because it feels like it wants to be here, and we are fortunate enough to be included in its existence.This film is about a man who truly lives in the moment without being some spiritual guru. He deals with whatever comes his way, the good, the bad and the ugly, and he welcomes it without words. That's because he doesn't need words. He doesn't need to analyze, remember or anticipate because ""now is now"". He accepts and embraces reality, finding joy in every little detail. But also not shying away from sorrow. But he never gets dramatic.And that's why this movie is so unique. There is no plot, there is no past full of hurt, there is no goal, there is no desire. Yet, it was mesmerizing, and I was glued to the screen. I was blown away. It's a movie that will stick with me for a long time.","12 January 2024","7/10"
"Perfect Days","Will not leave you empty-handed.","lovemichaeljordan","Just watched it in NYFF where it was received with standing ovation. Only Wim Wenders can create such a simple film without a narrative and make us glued for 2 hours. He tells the repetitive story of a public toilet cleaner at Tokyo as he goes thru his life during a 2 week period and it takes the form of a travel documentary. We can see a great blend of the pathos from Paris, Texas and the compassion from Wings of Desire. It also has an element of Jeanne Dielman as Hirayama goes thru his daily activities in a repetitive manner but with subtle deviations based on how other events unfold in his schedule.We get to know very little about his back story and how he ended up being a toilet cleaner. But we can form an opinion based on his choices in books, music and his interactions with his niece and his sister.I had the privilege of hearing Koji Yakusho live in a Q&A session after the movie and hear his perspectives.","20 December 2023","10/10"

I understand that adaptations are difficult to reflect in the same light as the original content but the direction style, casting, writing, acting, and animation of this movie was lazy, disrespectful, and devalued the core ideals of the series.

"The Last Airbender","glad i didn't pay","wazzaa-1","The world is divided into four kingdoms with each being able to control (bend) an element to their will. These benders (stop tittering at the back) are held in balance by the influence of the Avatar, a being who can control all elements as well as being a link to the spirit world. It has been 100 years since this Avatar vanished and in this time the various benders (stop it) have all been in conflict. The wars have been led by the flaming benders (seriously, stop it) who control fire and wiped out the air benders because they knew the Avatar was one of their number. With the air benders gone and the Avatar nowhere to be found, the benders are all under the thumb of the fire nation, with bending outlawed (like it used to be in the Isle of Man). When sibling waterbenders Katara and Sokka discover a child frozen below the waters near their town they rescue him only to quickly learn he is the Avatar. They join him in his quest to learn to be bend the other elements and also free the kingdoms from the tyranny of the fire nation.I've not watched the original series so in a way I came to this film free of the built-in criticism of those who love the series and were always going to be upset by a poor copy. Normally this would mean that a poor version might still be a good film but obviously in this case I did come with the knowledge that it had been universally slated by critics and mostly ignored by audiences. So basically I had no preconceptions of how the film should look or be but at the same time my expectations were low due to all the criticism I had heard. So I guess it is understandable that I come out of the film saying ""c'mon – it's not THAT bad"" because it is not the crime against humanity that some have suggested. The effects are pretty decent and as a result some of the sequences are decent if only on a technical level. And. And. Well, I guess I'm done providing the critical balance here, so onto the parts of the film that are not the ""pretty good"" effects.Sadly this ""rest of the film"" is the vast majority of the two hour running time and it is pretty poor. Maybe the plot has potential but from the evidence of this it is a terrible heavy mess of mythology and nonsense that might have struggled to works in the hands of someone really able. M. Night Shyamalan is not an able person – he is someone who appears to have had a couple of good ideas (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), a couple of so-so films and then a growing collections of stinkers, in which camp this film belongs. In the hands of Shyamalan it is overly worthy, clunky, self-important and just a big bore full of gas. It is no surprise that within this frame he has written dialogue that is equally pompous with lots of terribly stiff lines which are almost a pain to listen to. As director he fails his cast. The adults seem to have enough about them to at least have presence but the younger cast members seem totally lost in terms of what they are doing and are painfully stiff and have no presence. As a director of action he is lacking as well; OK he handles the effects well but the fights lack tension and excitement and just seem silly most of the time. To those that say that the action sequences were cool then I would suggest you check out the countless martial arts films that do them better, with actual excitement and impressive director and choreography – because those on display here are a poor copy of the genre.Overall, it comes to something when the best that one can say about a film is that it is not the abomination that he majority say it is. However this is not me saying it is good; because I'm not; because it's not; not at all. It is clunky, stiff, self-important and lacks any sense of adventure, fun, character or charm – it is frankly a bore. I could care less if Shyamalan has upset fans of the original series with his version – he could have done that and still presented the rest of us with a decent film – but he hasn't He can get shirty with journalists who ask him about the downward trajectory of his career but ultimately he is doing nothing to suggest it is headed any other direction – The Last Airbender is not the worst film ever made, but it certainly another in the growing pile of stinkers that has his Shyamalan's name attached to them.","27 May 2020","1/10"

It is beautifully animated, has great music, writing, story lines and characters and is quite deep for an animated series. I wasn't expecting this film to be faithful to the series but at least stick to its spirit. Sadly it didn't do that. The only redeeming qualities for me were the stunning cinematography and scenery and the beautiful music score. Everything else fails. Here banality replaces complexity, consequently the characters are poorly explored and very shallow. The script is absolutely awful with trite dialogue and wooden delivery, the story is juvenile and woefully misconcieved with heavy subplotting and the pacing is so dull it makes the film tedious. And to add further insult to injury, the direction is very bland, there is a complete overload of CGI and the acting is wooden from pretty much all involved.

"The Last Airbender","Self-important, stiff, clunky, dull and lacking any sort of spark or flair","bob the moo","I went into the movie knowing it would not be even a fraction as good as the real show. However, I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous, the only way to describe it is a $150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (with extras) almost religiously for the past month.The script in itself should have been tossed into the garbage and burnt and it's remains locked away so that no one would ever have to suffer looking at such garbage. That's why I'm not really sure if it's the actors or the script that's really to blame for the atrocious ""movie"" that's resulted. The long and, I'm assuming this what they were going for, ""inspirational"" speeches merely consisted of crudely strung together clichés and the language left much to be desired. I found myself almost twitching at the phrase (something along the lines) ""You guys are AWESOME people!""...What I find the be so incredibly amazing is how someone could honestly fail to such a proportion when they literally have a blue print already created. The fans know how the characters look and sound and while I understand that no one fits the package perfectly one out of two would be better than nothing. As well, suddenly deciding to change the pronunciation of the characters name is definitely not the best idea, while I do understand that he wanted the names to sound like their Asian origin, it didn't go over well and the whole time I was just cringing at the mere mention of Aang and Sokka's names.This movie does not hold a candle to the original show. Heck, it should be retitled as it is hardly resembles the original in any way shape or form. While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured, the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused. I, also, loathed the way they worked the bending in like it took five minutes of moving ones hands around awkwardly before any actual bending occurred. Most of the fighting was like fifteen minutes of martial arts with like the occasional bit of air bending and a little water being splashed around.There was nothing to love in this movie not even the most adorable of characters such as Momo. Momo had literally what three minutes in the entire movie which I found extremely depressing as Momo was always one of the characters I just wanted to cuddle because of his adorable mannerisms but in the movie I had no love for the digitized Momo. Not even Appa was interesting.This movie leaves me hoping and praying that M. Night Shyamalan goes broke and is black listed so that he can't ruin the series even more so. This is definitely something you will spend some time just trying to forget.","26 September 2010","1/10"
"The Last Airbender","Lazy lazy and utterly predictable","angel-591","The Last Airbender (2010) 1/2 (out of 4) After being freed from an iceberg, Aang (Noah Ringer), a long lost Avatar who is the only one able to bend the four elements, finds himself doing battle against the Fire Nation who who attempting to take over all three Nations (Air, Water, Earth). M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER is based on the very popular television show, which is something I've never seen so I pretty much walked into this not knowing what to expect from the story. I'll admit by the ten-minute mark I was pretty much lost in regards to the story and each passing minute I found myself growing even more confused. I then had to do something I never do, which was stop the movie and call someone familiar with the TV series and this film to try and find out what the heck was supposed to be going on. I painfully sat through the rest of the movie and afterwards I started to read other reviews and I was happy to see that I wasn't the only one who couldn't make any sense out of this material. I will say that I think Shyamalan has gotten some pretty bad beatings over his recent films, which I think were unfair but there's no doubt that he deserves the majority of the blame here, although I think a very strong argument could be made that those who hired him should be on fans hit list more than Shyamalan. The biggest fault of his was the screenplay, which simply doesn't make any sense as the story is always jumping from one place to another and none it ever seems connected. From what I've gathered he was jumping around so many parts of the show that unless you're familiar with it you weren't going to know what's going on here. Even worse are the actors who are all extremely bad and come off even worse when they have to say the bad dialogue. I don't like to attack child actors so I won't mention any of them by name but what were the producers thinking when they agreed to cast them? Surely there were more talented people out in Hollywood. The special effects are all poor, the action badly directed and even worse is that there's simply nothing here to care about. Some nice cinematography is about the only thing going for this turkey, which is every bit the misfire its reputation would have you believe.","1 July 2010","2/10"
"The Last Airbender","The most inept film-making I have seen in years","MovieManPat","I recently watched the animated series with my two older kids. After finishing that masterpiece, they heard about the live-action adaptation. Having never seen it myself, I thought we might as well give it a chance. I was wrong.I tried to go in with an open mind, but this movie is terrible. The film started with the changed iconic intro, and I knew we were in trouble. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have changed anything. The problem is that they changed the elements that already worked.The name pronunciation (Aang, Iroh, Sokka, etc.) is frustrating and on the verge of laughable. The plot drags, yet skips important points, with Katara's voiceover glossing over key details. Character development is non-existent, with Sokka's character completely devoid of personality. The casting is atrocious, and I cannot think of a single ""hit"" in the group. The acting is bland, and the costumes are even blander.This film had so much potential. A great director, excellent source material and a loyal fanbase. Unfortunately, the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was never muttered in the writer's room.

A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.But really, even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame.

"The Last Airbender","Shyamalan Should Be Ashamed","chicagorob1","To draw attention to the facile manner in which the producer/director chose to re-imagine this tale, here is a ""connect the dots"" review. Like the movie itself, the review is simple to the point of emptiness:1. The original series LAST AIRBENDER was not merely good, it was one of the most original and best written series in the history of TV. Not merely compelling but actually offering a spiritual undertone for the discerning ear. It was not merely for children but for adults as well. Its fame and popularity, its iconic stature, was well earned. (The ""Korra"" sequel, not so much.) 2. Much speculation has been directed to how this film came about? The most popular theory is that a whack of cash was handed to the producer/director at a low point in his career and to this day it remains a matter of conjecture as to how much actually made it to the screen?? 3.

"The Last Airbender","glad i didn't pay","wazzaa-1","The world is divided into four kingdoms with each being able to control (bend) an element to their will. These benders (stop tittering at the back) are held in balance by the influence of the Avatar, a being who can control all elements as well as being a link to the spirit world. It has been 100 years since this Avatar vanished and in this time the various benders (stop it) have all been in conflict. The wars have been led by the flaming benders (seriously, stop it) who control fire and wiped out the air benders because they knew the Avatar was one of their number. With the air benders gone and the Avatar nowhere to be found, the benders are all under the thumb of the fire nation, with bending outlawed (like it used to be in the Isle of Man). When sibling waterbenders Katara and Sokka discover a child frozen below the waters near their town they rescue him only to quickly learn he is the Avatar. They join him in his quest to learn to be bend the other elements and also free the kingdoms from the tyranny of the fire nation.I've not watched the original series so in a way I came to this film free of the built-in criticism of those who love the series and were always going to be upset by a poor copy. Normally this would mean that a poor version might still be a good film but obviously in this case I did come with the knowledge that it had been universally slated by critics and mostly ignored by audiences. So basically I had no preconceptions of how the film should look or be but at the same time my expectations were low due to all the criticism I had heard. So I guess it is understandable that I come out of the film saying ""c'mon – it's not THAT bad"" because it is not the crime against humanity that some have suggested. The effects are pretty decent and as a result some of the sequences are decent if only on a technical level. And. And. Well, I guess I'm done providing the critical balance here, so onto the parts of the film that are not the ""pretty good"" effects.Sadly this ""rest of the film"" is the vast majority of the two hour running time and it is pretty poor. Maybe the plot has potential but from the evidence of this it is a terrible heavy mess of mythology and nonsense that might have struggled to works in the hands of someone really able. M. Night Shyamalan is not an able person – he is someone who appears to have had a couple of good ideas (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), a couple of so-so films and then a growing collections of stinkers, in which camp this film belongs. In the hands of Shyamalan it is overly worthy, clunky, self-important and just a big bore full of gas. It is no surprise that within this frame he has written dialogue that is equally pompous with lots of terribly stiff lines which are almost a pain to listen to. As director he fails his cast. The adults seem to have enough about them to at least have presence but the younger cast members seem totally lost in terms of what they are doing and are painfully stiff and have no presence. As a director of action he is lacking as well; OK he handles the effects well but the fights lack tension and excitement and just seem silly most of the time. To those that say that the action sequences were cool then I would suggest you check out the countless martial arts films that do them better, with actual excitement and impressive director and choreography – because those on display here are a poor copy of the genre.Overall, it comes to something when the best that one can say about a film is that it is not the abomination that he majority say it is. However this is not me saying it is good; because I'm not; because it's not; not at all. It is clunky, stiff, self-important and lacks any sense of adventure, fun, character or charm – it is frankly a bore. I could care less if Shyamalan has upset fans of the original series with his version – he could have done that and still presented the rest of us with a decent film – but he hasn't He can get shirty with journalists who ask him about the downward trajectory of his career but ultimately he is doing nothing to suggest it is headed any other direction – The Last Airbender is not the worst film ever made, but it certainly another in the growing pile of stinkers that has his Shyamalan's name attached to them.","27 May 2020","1/10"

While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured, the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused.

M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER is based on the very popular television show, which is something I've never seen so I pretty much walked into this not knowing what to expect from the story.

The biggest fault of his was the screenplay, which simply doesn't make any sense as the story is always jumping from one place to another and none it ever seems connected. From what I've gathered he was jumping around so many parts of the show that unless you're familiar with it you weren't going to know what's going on here.

I don't like to attack child actors so I won't mention any of them by name but what were the producers thinking when they agreed to cast them? Surely there were more talented people out in Hollywood.

A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding.

The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame.

"The Last Airbender","Shyamalan Should Be Ashamed","chicagorob1","To draw attention to the facile manner in which the producer/director chose to re-imagine this tale, here is a ""connect the dots"" review. Like the movie itself, the review is simple to the point of emptiness:1. The original series LAST AIRBENDER was not merely good, it was one of the most original and best written series in the history of TV. Not merely compelling but actually offering a spiritual undertone for the discerning ear. It was not merely for children but for adults as well. Its fame and popularity, its iconic stature, was well earned. (The ""Korra"" sequel, not so much.) 2. Much speculation has been directed to how this film came about? The most popular theory is that a whack of cash was handed to the producer/director at a low point in his career and to this day it remains a matter of conjecture as to how much actually made it to the screen?? 3. Another mystery is why the casting is so bizarre -- with many actors borrowed from Bollywood -- and why the director felt compelled to ""leave his mark"" on this already-abused production by changing the pronunciation of the names of the major characters...? 4. Astonishingly, the IMDb reviews and those of the professional critics completely agree. This film is terrible. The only redeeming factor is that APPA the flying bison steals all his scenes, a claim that no human actor in this film can make.5. In many ways it is an astonishing feat to take such a compelling and heart-warming tale and transmute it into an ""after-school special"" that harks back to the production values of a Dr Who episode in the 1970s.

"The Last Airbender","Shyamalan Should Be Ashamed","chicagorob1","To draw attention to the facile manner in which the producer/director chose to re-imagine this tale, here is a ""connect the dots"" review. Like the movie itself, the review is simple to the point of emptiness:1. The original series LAST AIRBENDER was not merely good, it was one of the most original and best written series in the history of TV. Not merely compelling but actually offering a spiritual undertone for the discerning ear. It was not merely for children but for adults as well. Its fame and popularity, its iconic stature, was well earned. (The ""Korra"" sequel, not so much.) 2. Much speculation has been directed to how this film came about? The most popular theory is that a whack of cash was handed to the producer/director at a low point in his career and to this day it remains a matter of conjecture as to how much actually made it to the screen?? 3. Another mystery is why the casting is so bizarre -- with many actors borrowed from Bollywood -- and why the director felt compelled to ""leave his mark"" on this already-abused production by changing the pronunciation of the names of the major characters...? 4. Astonishingly, the IMDb reviews and those of the professional critics completely agree. This film is terrible. The only redeeming factor is that APPA the flying bison steals all his scenes, a claim that no human actor in this film can make.5. In many ways it is an astonishing feat to take such a compelling and heart-warming tale and transmute it into an ""after-school special"" that harks back to the production values of a Dr Who episode in the 1970s.

"The Last Airbender","glad i didn't pay","wazzaa-1","The world is divided into four kingdoms with each being able to control (bend) an element to their will. These benders (stop tittering at the back) are held in balance by the influence of the Avatar, a being who can control all elements as well as being a link to the spirit world. It has been 100 years since this Avatar vanished and in this time the various benders (stop it) have all been in conflict. The wars have been led by the flaming benders (seriously, stop it) who control fire and wiped out the air benders because they knew the Avatar was one of their number. With the air benders gone and the Avatar nowhere to be found, the benders are all under the thumb of the fire nation, with bending outlawed (like it used to be in the Isle of Man). When sibling waterbenders Katara and Sokka discover a child frozen below the waters near their town they rescue him only to quickly learn he is the Avatar. They join him in his quest to learn to be bend the other elements and also free the kingdoms from the tyranny of the fire nation.I've not watched the original series so in a way I came to this film free of the built-in criticism of those who love the series and were always going to be upset by a poor copy. Normally this would mean that a poor version might still be a good film but obviously in this case I did come with the knowledge that it had been universally slated by critics and mostly ignored by audiences. So basically I had no preconceptions of how the film should look or be but at the same time my expectations were low due to all the criticism I had heard. So I guess it is understandable that I come out of the film saying ""c'mon – it's not THAT bad"" because it is not the crime against humanity that some have suggested. The effects are pretty decent and as a result some of the sequences are decent if only on a technical level. And. And. Well, I guess I'm done providing the critical balance here, so onto the parts of the film that are not the ""pretty good"" effects.Sadly this ""rest of the film"" is the vast majority of the two hour running time and it is pretty poor. Maybe the plot has potential but from the evidence of this it is a terrible heavy mess of mythology and nonsense that might have struggled to works in the hands of someone really able. M. Night Shyamalan is not an able person – he is someone who appears to have had a couple of good ideas (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), a couple of so-so films and then a growing collections of stinkers, in which camp this film belongs. In the hands of Shyamalan it is overly worthy, clunky, self-important and just a big bore full of gas. It is no surprise that within this frame he has written dialogue that is equally pompous with lots of terribly stiff lines which are almost a pain to listen to. As director he fails his cast. The adults seem to have enough about them to at least have presence but the younger cast members seem totally lost in terms of what they are doing and are painfully stiff and have no presence. As a director of action he is lacking as well; OK he handles the effects well but the fights lack tension and excitement and just seem silly most of the time. To those that say that the action sequences were cool then I would suggest you check out the countless martial arts films that do them better, with actual excitement and impressive director and choreography – because those on display here are a poor copy of the genre.Overall, it comes to something when the best that one can say about a film is that it is not the abomination that he majority say it is. However this is not me saying it is good; because I'm not; because it's not; not at all. It is clunky, stiff, self-important and lacks any sense of adventure, fun, character or charm – it is frankly a bore. I could care less if Shyamalan has upset fans of the original series with his version – he could have done that and still presented the rest of us with a decent film – but he hasn't He can get shirty with journalists who ask him about the downward trajectory of his career but ultimately he is doing nothing to suggest it is headed any other direction – The Last Airbender is not the worst film ever made, but it certainly another in the growing pile of stinkers that has his Shyamalan's name attached to them.","27 May 2020","1/10"

M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER is based on the very popular television show, which is something I've never seen so I pretty much walked into this not knowing what to expect from the story. I'll admit by the ten-minute mark I was pretty much lost in regards to the story and each passing minute I found myself growing even more confused.

The biggest fault of his was the screenplay, which simply doesn't make any sense as the story is always jumping from one place to another and none it ever seems connected. From what I've gathered he was jumping around so many parts of the show that unless you're familiar with it you weren't going to know what's going on here.

I don't like to attack child actors so I won't mention any of them by name but what were the producers thinking when they agreed to cast them? Surely there were more talented people out in Hollywood.

After finishing that masterpiece, they heard about the live-action adaptation. Having never seen it myself, I thought we might as well give it a chance. I was wrong.I tried to go in with an open mind, but this movie is terrible. The film started with the changed iconic intro, and I knew we were in trouble. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have changed anything. The problem is that they changed the elements that already worked.The name pronunciation (Aang, Iroh, Sokka, etc.) is frustrating and on the verge of laughable. The plot drags, yet skips important points, with Katara's voiceover glossing over key details. Character development is non-existent, with Sokka's character completely devoid of personality. The casting is atrocious, and I cannot think of a single ""hit"" in the group. The acting is bland, and the costumes are even blander.This film had so much potential. A great director, excellent source material and a loyal fanbase. Unfortunately, the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was never muttered in the writer's room. The series was full of so much joy and this film is just joyless.Worst Character: Sokka
Worst Quote: ""Aang? Can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return."" - Katara
Worst Scene: The Earthbender Revolt

The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding.

The plot drags, yet skips important points, with Katara's voiceover glossing over key details. Character development is non-existent, with Sokka's character completely devoid of personality. The casting is atrocious, and I cannot think of a single ""hit"" in the group. The acting is bland, and the costumes are even blander.This film had so much potential. A great director, excellent source material and a loyal fanbase. Unfortunately, the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was never muttered in the writer's room. The series was full of so much joy and this film is just joyless.Worst Character: Sokka
Worst Quote: ""Aang? Can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return."" - Katara
Worst Scene: The Earthbender Revolt
Best Piece of Score (I actually liked the score): ""Flow Like Water""Note: Why was there so much movement for minimal bending?","9 December 2010","1/10"
"The Last Airbender","Beautiful images and score, but tedious and misconcieved","TheLittleSongbird","I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations. I didn't expect something as good as the cartoon, I didn't expect a perfect adaptation. I expected some glitzy action sequences, cheap emotional ploys, just some fun summer fair.What did I get? A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.But really, even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame. It could have been so good.","17 July 2011","1/10"
"The Last Airbender","Shyamalan Should Be Ashamed","chicagorob1","To draw attention to the facile manner in which the producer/director chose to re-imagine this tale, here is a ""connect the dots"" review. Like the movie itself, the review is simple to the point of emptiness:1. The original series LAST AIRBENDER was not merely good, it was one of the most original and best written series in the history of TV. Not merely compelling but actually offering a spiritual undertone for the discerning ear. It was not merely for children but for adults as well. Its fame and popularity, its iconic stature, was well earned. (The ""Korra"" sequel, not so much.) 2. Much speculation has been directed to how this film came about? The most popular theory is that a whack of cash was handed to the producer/director at a low point in his career and to this day it remains a matter of conjecture as to how much actually made it to the screen?? 3. Another mystery is why the casting is so bizarre -- with many actors borrowed from Bollywood -- and why the director felt compelled to ""leave his mark"" on this already-abused production by changing the pronunciation of the names of the major characters...? 4. Astonishingly, the IMDb reviews and those of the professional critics completely agree. This film is terrible. The only redeeming factor is that APPA the flying bison steals all his scenes, a claim that no human actor in this film can make.5. In many ways it is an astonishing feat to take such a compelling and heart-warming tale and transmute it into an ""after-school special"" that harks back to the production values of a Dr Who episode in the 1970s.

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Godlike","southdavid","I've written individual reviews for each season of ""Fleabag"" but as it's becoming apparent that any more is unlikely, I thought I'd post a composite of the two reviews here, to give an appraisal of the whole run.I'd been putting of ""Fleabag"" for a while, trying to let the weight of expectation die down a little, given how critically adored it is. However, the first season really lived up to its reputation as a clever, witty comedy.Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a hedonistic young woman whose fractured relationships with her family have been caused by her inability to cope with the deaths of both her mother, and more recently her best friend. The café they co-owned is struggling and her relationship seems to have come to a permanent end. She struggles to make valid connections with anyone except us, the audience.What can I say other than the show lived up to its reputation. It's funny, clever and vulgar at the same time. Fleabag is a great character, wonderfully played by Waller-Bridge and the rest of the cast a similarly excellent too, particularly Bill Paterson as her father and Olivia Colman as her wicked god/stepmum. Even though I really liked the first run, I wasn't prepared for just how much of a step up the second season would be. It's genuinely, one of the funniest, most enjoyable seasons of comedy I've seen in a long while. There's one immediate and obvious reason for the season two improvement. In the first episodes, any love interest for Fleabag wasn't a match for her wit or temperament, they were a punchline. Here Andrew Scott's ""Hot Priest"" is a fully rounded character, with his own issues and can both punch back and enjoy sparring with her. . It's just funnier all round though, even better written, more moving and, as it appears at the moment that this is all we're ever going to get, tinged with a bittersweet sadness - particularly in the final moments.Just glorious, wonderful TV.","20 March 2019","9/10"

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Very funny","grantss","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.Can't fault the casting nor performances.

However, the first season really lived up to its reputation as a clever, witty comedy.Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a hedonistic young woman whose fractured relationships with her family have been caused by her inability to cope with the deaths of both her mother, and more recently her best friend. The café they co-owned is struggling and her relationship seems to have come to a permanent end. She struggles to make valid connections with anyone except us, the audience.What can I say other than the show lived up to its reputation. It's funny, clever and vulgar at the same time. Fleabag is a great character, wonderfully played by Waller-Bridge and the rest of the cast a similarly excellent too, particularly Bill Paterson as her father and Olivia Colman as her wicked god/stepmum. Even though I really liked the first run, I wasn't prepared for just how much of a step up the second season would be. It's genuinely, one of the funniest, most enjoyable seasons of comedy I've seen in a long while. There's one immediate and obvious reason for the season two improvement. In the first episodes, any love interest for Fleabag wasn't a match for her wit or temperament, they were a punchline. Here Andrew Scott's ""Hot Priest"" is a fully rounded character, with his own issues and can both punch back and enjoy sparring with her. . It's just funnier all round though, even better written, more moving and, as it appears at the moment that this is all we're ever going to get, tinged with a bittersweet sadness - particularly in the final moments.Just glorious, wonderful TV.","20 March 2019","9/10"

"Fleabag (2016–2019)","Very funny","grantss","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.Can't fault the casting nor performances.

I mean, I feel like I would have missed something watching this at home instead of with a theatre filled with women who laughed out loud to situations I just found passingly amusing.

I like the visual style, especially with the outfits. There are a few memorable moments within an overall enjoyable story.Why not a higher score? I don't really have any dislikes. Everything in the movie is above average, but no single aspect excels. It's pretty funny but not hilarious. The horror elements are fun but very mild. I was somewhat engaged and invested but not fully locked in or excited.In the end, I had a good time with this movie as a one-time viewing. I think most people will find it enjoyable with a small group of people who love it.(1 viewing, early screening Screen Unseen 2/5/2024)","9 February 2024","6/10"
"Lisa Frankenstien","Lisa Frankenstein has worthwhile elements but falls short of its potential. This does have a target audience that wil","kevin_robbins","My wife and I attended a screening of Lisa Frankenstein (2024) this evening. The storyline follows a young lady whose mother was recently killed by an ax murderer. Her father remarries, and they move to a new home with her new mom and stepsister. A nearby haunted graveyard becomes her fascination, especially a young man's tombstone. One day, her prayer and lightening revive him, but he needs new body parts.Directed by Zelda Williams in her major motion picture debut, the film stars Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), Cole Sprouse (Riverdale), Liza Soberano (Trese), Carla Gugino (The Fall of the House of Usher), and Joe Chrest (Stranger Things).The film is unfortunately uneven and has a solid beginning reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands, capturing an early Tim Burton feel with its 1989 setting. The attire, soundtrack, sets, and cinematography contribute to this atmosphere. The opening credits' animation and creative sets are praiseworthy, and the dialogue exudes cleverness with a perfect dark comedy feel. While horror elements and kills are hit or miss, the film showcases elite slow-motion blood splatter (making me wonder why more films don't leverage that special effect). However, certain scenes, like the awkward backing away and police interrogation, feel forced and out of place. The hunched-over walk scenes also detract from the overall tone. The ending, however, is a positive note.In conclusion, Lisa Frankenstein has worthwhile elements but falls short of its potential. I would score this a 5/10 but recommend watching it once. This does have a target audience that will love it.","9 February 2024","5/10"

In that respect it is similar to Beetlejuice for me personally. A totally campy film with a lot of things that don't make sense or aren't fully explained; it feels like there are some deleted scenes that should have been left in, but maybe they were concerned about the film running too long and kept it short and simple.Kathryn Newton gives an excellent performance as the main character, and her dad reminds me so much of the dad in Coraline.It's simply entertaining dark humor in a teen angst storyline! I totally recommend it for a fun night out.","9 February 2024","6/10"
"Lisa Frankenstien","This Should Have Been R-Rated","kjproulx","This is one of the oddest experiences I've had at the movies in a while. Lisa Frankenstein is a film where the idea seemed fun, the people involved have made things I've enjoyed in the past, and the cast seemed to be having a great time, so what went wrong for me? Well, I think it all comes down to the fact that this movie is trying to be accessible to a wide age spectrum, but that made the movie lose a bit of its charm. This is easily a script that should've taken it one step further and been rated R. Many films have done similar premises to this one in the past, and while I won't say they were all better in concept, the final products say otherwise. Let me explain myself.Taking place in 1989, Lisa (Kathryn Newton), a teenager with a few questionable traits, wishes to be with someone who is dead and she has never met. His corpse is reanimated after she wishes upon his grave and a mysterious storm hits. From here, even though he can't speak, they become close and kind of psychotic. This very quickly becomes a twisted and messed up movie, but under the PG-13 banner, it just felt watered down. There are multiple instances when limbs are chopped off or people are murdered, and while it all is done in the spirit of having a good, weird time at the movies, it lacks the visuals of everything that was going on.Kathryn Newton is quite enjoyable as Lisa and I wish the film had better dialogue for her because even though there is some clever writing and she made me laugh quite often, she is a much darker character than the PG-13 rating allowed her to be. Cole Sprouse (in my opinion) has honestly never been better though. He has no lines, but that made for some great physical acting. For a character without dialogue, he held his own against Newton here. Carla Gugino plays Lisa's stepmother and where that story leads is easily the highlight of the film, but again, every great idea this film had just felt watered down. I feel like a broken record talking about this one simply because I think this had all the bones of a great, fun, weird movie. There is also one scene in particular where I was laughing because I couldn't believe what I was watching, but the movie couldn't go far enough to show it actually happening. That was the majority of my experience here, even though the film was clever enough to be mildly enjoyable as it is.Look, Zelda Williams does a solid job at directing here, Diablo Cody's script is sharp, but does add the extra flare that was needed, I liked every performance, and it absolutely felt like it was from the '80s/'90s. Everyone did a very solid job bringing this screenplay to life. Everything about this movie from the set design to the bright, visual aesthetic all worked for me and should be commended, I just can't wrap my head around why this one wasn't rated R, especially considering certain things that happen or are implied here.

"Lisa Frankenstien","Lisa, her Victorian boyfriend and a tanning bed.","chand-suhas","Lisa Swallows is a teen girl embracing the goth phase and she is lonely post her mother's murder. Her father has remarried and she is tormented by her step mother Janet while her step sister Taffy is the only one who is nice to her. Lisa finds a Victorian corpse who is reanimated by a lightning. He soon becomes Lisa's saviour and she helps him get back the replacement for his missing body parts, making way for their love story driven by violence. How does Lisa realize her love for him forms rest of the story.It almost worked for me but I have to be honest and say this got released a couple of decades late. The genre it touches upon is bold enough, a teen romance story which is also a zom-com as well as a coming of age story, it tries to juggle a lot yet the end result felt less than satisfactory. Probably the humor not working as intended was the major blow to the narrative. There isn't much intrigue left once the Victorian corpse is reanimated and the story moves in the predictable manner and turns too gothy with Lisa's character quite late.","10 February 2024","4/10"
"Lisa Frankenstien","The love child of John Waters and Tim Burton","mjanelle-24974","Essentially a blind watch, I must say I surprisingly enjoyed this film.Lisa Frankenstein was surprisingly enjoyable. It was completely ridiculous and completely stupid, but I found its quirkiness oddly endearing and sweet.Great performances from the supporting cast and Lisa played fantastically by the beautifully talented Kathryn Newton. She is quickly becoming a favorite actress of mine.Overall, while I most certainly enjoyed the film, there were certain elements that didn't completely work for me that I'm sure would work for others.Charming, endearing, and darkly humorous makes Lisa Frankenstein a worthwhile watch that I, for one, did not see myself enjoying.PS. Still a better love story than Twilight.IMDb: 6/10

"Lisa Frankenstien","Not what I expected","nscoby93","Cute, Heartfelt, Candy-colored, and Twisted. When I tell you this movie had my WHOLE HEART from the title screen alone ?? -sobs- It's Heathers and Edward Scissorhands and campy and hilarious but also unique and its own thing, with hard nods to A Trip To The Moon, and NOTTING HILL. I EXPLODED.And I was already a fan from Freaky but now I'm just a full on Kathryn Newton spazz, she gives the quirkiest, silliest, most endearing performance. And Cole Sprouse gave a really lovely, nuanced performance too. Liza Soberano (Taffy) was hilarious too, everyone was just really perfect.The cuteness of this movie actually unalived me and now I need a tanning bed. The End.","8 February 2024","6/10"
"Lisa Frankenstien","Felt it becoming my new fav movie while it was still going...","JK-WhatsUpWeirdoPodcast","6.8/10 (Would Recommend)If you have someone that can enjoy a kind of cheesy, a little romantic, and slightly gruesome romcom horror movie then ""Lisa Frankenstein"" may be for you. The film is nonchalant when it comes to its stabby stab scenes. You're left with this ""oh, okay... that happened"".There's some good moments that threw me for a loop, but that was part of the charm. Kathryn Newton and Cole Sprouse have really good chemistry together and both bring unique, fun charm to their roles. Cole showed a bit of his acting range by bringing good emotion to his role by not speaking a single word .I'm probably one of the least fashionable people you will ever meet so take this with a grain of salt. I loved the wardrobe selection for Kathryn Newton and the movement between how we meet her to what she becomes is perfectly worked into the film.I didn't find this film to be terrible, but it just wasn't super strong in parts. It gets distracting when the same extra very obviously passes through the same scene twice. Some of the camera shots were a little iffy when it came to speaking parts.Overall, this won't be every one's type of film, but it's nice to have been with someone who did enjoy it as well. It was nice to be a little surprised by how not so fluffy the film appeared to be. It's fun, kind of gruesome, a little dirty on the romance, but it all works out in the end.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","14 February 2024","10/10"
"Lisa Frankenstien","A wild, fun, and quirky time","PerryAtTheMovies","""They say 'Time heals wounds' but actually, 'Time is the wound.'""In the year 1989, one's life is about to change forever because of a storm. This is a strange take on Frankenstein's story with something special about it. A film that is entertaining enough and if you do love the 80s, that ""Sweeney Todd"" vibes, if you love Kathryn Newton, Jughead Jones / Cole Sprouse, this film is for you. Kudos to Liza Soberano's first appearance in a Hollywood film. She did an amazing job and deserves to have more.Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton did deliver a good performance here too.A film that I could recommend watching. It was fun to watch!Loved that they still used When in Rome's The Promise in the film (not just in the trailer).","7 February 2024","7/10"

They had no chemistry, they did supposedly have reasons for pursuing each other but it wasn't depicted in a convincing manner. Sometimes I liked it, sometimes I didn't.

Yes, her character is supposed to be strong, opinionated, witty, charming, seductive... But she fails to deliver any of it! She doesn't seem like clever teenage girl suddenly shaken and intrigued by an unexpected new variable in her life, at times she kinda looks bored. Her narrating was good though. But like I mentioned, the main point of the movie, the taboo of the desire and magnetism between main characters, is absolutely lacking.

"Millers Girl","A pretty good film when reflected a bit upon it","vmagrigjr","Miller's Girl presents a perspective of a romantic affair between a student (Jenna Ortega as Cairo Sweet) and its teacher (Martin Freeman as Jonathan Miller). It is a very ambitious and intriguing idea to explore, I really liked the plot and how it slowly unfolded, how the characters evolved and how eventually Cairo and Martin turned out to be complex characters that carried a lot of personal and professional baggage yet they connected and felt heard and understood thanks to their mutual interest in literature and writing. Now, obviously there's a lot more that's going on, more nuances, subtlety and delicacy and not to even mention the other ""situationship"" presented but it makes you wonder on another level... does love have limits? Is there such a thing as a forbidden love? Does even right or wrong exist when love is involved? Or, at the same time... is it really about love or is it something else?Both Freeman and Ortega deliver good performances and it serve their characters well, but it sometimes felt during the first acts like they lacked that chemistry, that connection that was supposed to urge their attraction, desire, tension; that ""I want it so bad that nothing else matters""; their interaction with other characters involved seemed more natural than when they were together.Jade Halley Bartlett creates this motion picture with a sort of aristocratic dark fantasy visual language and score in mind which plays an important part in the production itself especially in certain scenes implying the ideas of mystery, of desire, even of the forbidden and the unacceptable - yet, it felt a bit all over the place and unnecessary at times because it created a few clichés such as the mysterious girl that comes out of a misty forest thingy and it just pulls you out of the story.Throughout the film it seems to be an incomplete puzzle yet in such a good way because you get most of the pieces, but you also have to create the missing ones by yourself. The ending is arguably the most impactful and well made on this matter because even though an open ending is not reinventing the wheel, this time the final scene can actually be interpreted in such many ways, all of them viable and credible since, as earlier mentioned, the film was packed with many nuances and tones, hints and implies of what actually might have happened.The film is pretty good when reflected a bit upon it.","5 February 2024","7/10"

"Millers Girl","A pretty good film when reflected a bit upon it","vmagrigjr","Miller's Girl presents a perspective of a romantic affair between a student (Jenna Ortega as Cairo Sweet) and its teacher (Martin Freeman as Jonathan Miller). It is a very ambitious and intriguing idea to explore, I really liked the plot and how it slowly unfolded, how the characters evolved and how eventually Cairo and Martin turned out to be complex characters that carried a lot of personal and professional baggage yet they connected and felt heard and understood thanks to their mutual interest in literature and writing. Now, obviously there's a lot more that's going on, more nuances, subtlety and delicacy and not to even mention the other ""situationship"" presented but it makes you wonder on another level... does love have limits? Is there such a thing as a forbidden love? Does even right or wrong exist when love is involved? Or, at the same time... is it really about love or is it something else?Both Freeman and Ortega deliver good performances and it serve their characters well, but it sometimes felt during the first acts like they lacked that chemistry, that connection that was supposed to urge their attraction, desire, tension; that ""I want it so bad that nothing else matters""; their interaction with other characters involved seemed more natural than when they were together.Jade Halley Bartlett creates this motion picture with a sort of aristocratic dark fantasy visual language and score in mind which plays an important part in the production itself especially in certain scenes implying the ideas of mystery, of desire, even of the forbidden and the unacceptable - yet, it felt a bit all over the place and unnecessary at times because it created a few clichés such as the mysterious girl that comes out of a misty forest thingy and it just pulls you out of the story.Throughout the film it seems to be an incomplete puzzle yet in such a good way because you get most of the pieces, but you also have to create the missing ones by yourself. The ending is arguably the most impactful and well made on this matter because even though an open ending is not reinventing the wheel, this time the final scene can actually be interpreted in such many ways, all of them viable and credible since, as earlier mentioned, the film was packed with many nuances and tones, hints and implies of what actually might have happened.The film is pretty good when reflected a bit upon it.","5 February 2024","7/10"

Yes, her character is supposed to be strong, opinionated, witty, charming, seductive... But she fails to deliver any of it! She doesn't seem like clever teenage girl suddenly shaken and intrigued by an unexpected new variable in her life, at times she kinda looks bored. Her narrating was good though. But like I mentioned, the main point of the movie, the taboo of the desire and magnetism between main characters, is absolutely lacking.

Zero emotions and no chemistry between father and son....not even close to a worst family drama and yes it's not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity.

"Animal","But why Bollywood? Are you punishing us for keeping even the tiniest hope that Bollywood might improve?","ashtamiraj","Animal is classic Bollywood garbage-rife with misogyny and senseless plot twists. The film lacks a cohesive storyline, drowning in a sea of unnecessary turns. What's truly entertaining is sifting through the suspicious 10/10 ratings. It becomes a game to spot the paid or bot-generated reviews, making this detective work more enjoyable than enduring the movie itself. In the realm of Bollywood disappointments, this movie serves as a reminder of the challenges in Bollywood filmmaking, where lackluster plots, an abundance of unnecessary twists, and a distressing dose of misogyny can overshadow any cinematic potential.","2 December 2023","1/10"

It has insane cruelty, misconduct, abuse that gives you yuckky feeling in 95% of the movie. I can not believe people spent so much money to watch this movie on theater, again proves the fact that nasty and filthy things still sold at a hight price in market.

Anil Kapoor and boby are wasted totally, the film story is from the age where there are no law and enforcement exists you can do whatever you want to either it's your own country or you are in foreign kill as many people as want .... to make a century of corpses is like a piece of cake. Zero emotions and no chemistry between father and son....not even close to a worst family drama and yes it's not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity.

Too many instances where basic questions and clarity in communication would've reduced the screen time from three hours to two hours max. The worst part is the director is planning on a sequel soon.If you value your hard earned money and your mental health, I would advise you to abstain from watching this 3 and a half hour torture of a film.","1 December 2023","1/10"
"Animal","Such a shame for even animals to name this movie","ali-79-997033","I would have given negative star if there would have been any option for that. This is a movie of the animal, for the animal and by the animal. Its just like a cancer which grows slowly inside your mind.Talking about film I feel that showing physopath character would have been justified if you prove that character to be wrong at the end of the movie. But it was opposite and proved him to be a macho man of what he has done. Sandeep Sir I must say you or directors like you are already sick. Hence, your films are a cancer for our societies.Talking about some of the fans, you also feel somewhere powerless in your life or feel like I am being oppressed under someone who is ruling or exploiting me. In this case, a revenge thought process develops inside your mind very slowly which in result reflects in such a way that when you starts watching these kind of gore/violence genre movies, you start loving all of that whether how much of gore scenes is being shown because you start feeling like yes this is me, this is my character and I also would have done this for taking revenge if I would have got chance. Your love towards violence genre goes to that much of extent that you even slam or backfires at those like me who criticizes these movies. But honestly speaking this is not your fault.

Just a garbage storyline put into together just to satisfy some men and fantasy of the director.From begining till the end, it normalized cheating by men, disrespect to women etc. The director clealry showed his disrespect towards women in life and showed unrealistic and unmatched masculity through raw sex scenes and violence.Movie is sickening to its core and breaks the society even more to disrespect women.Tried to imitate a bad version of bdsm movie like fifty shades of grey but conveyed very dark.","3 December 2023","1/10"

She mumbles a lot and sometimes it looks like her jaw is frozen. I don't know why she was casted in this movie. Her acting is REALLY REALLY bad and her character has ABSOLUTELY no self respect in the movie. Women in the movie are just props, like any other Vanga movie. Ranbir's acting is good.

"Animal","It was embarrassing to watch the movie after a point.","tanvidavid","""Animal,"" directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, offers a captivating experience with impressive background music, memorable songs, and technical finesse. However, the film stumbles in terms of story strength and screenplay execution, featuring temporal shifts that lack coherence and fail to enhance the narrative.While the first half engages with its fast pace, the second half unnecessarily prolongs the story, leaving the film feeling overly lengthy and lacking character development, especially with Ranbir Kapoor's character. His abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning, contributing to a disjointed narrative.Despite a touching emotional scene between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor towards the end, it arrives too late, leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure. The credit scenes, though appealing, add to the film's unnecessary length.Ranbir Kapoor's character, portrayed as a hero, raises concerns due to his criminal actions, lack of respect for others, blatant misogyny, and attitude problems. The film's attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic, as it glorifies a man-child who in reality needs therapy.Actress Rashmika Mandanna's performance is very poor, making her unfit for the role. She was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayal.It's disheartening to witness Bollywood failing with films like ""Animal.""

"Ferrari","Could have been a lot better","ethanbresnett","For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough.","7 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","Very disappointing","Jeremy_Urquhart","This felt sadly dreadful to me, for the most part. Ferrari is a film where it feels like very few people involved cared about what they were making. On paper, the idea to focus on one brief period of time was a good one, rather than trying to capture a single figure's life story. Adam Driver is probably my favorite actor who's risen to prominence since 2010, and Michael Mann's a filmmaker whose work I generally enjoy. The idea of them teaming up to make a movie sounded promising, but the execution here was just lifeless and strangely amateur.Much of the film's shot with a floaty, aimless camera that frames things strangely in an attempt to look unique, or because of simple incompetence; the way it sometimes shakes and drifts or zooms in and out seemingly by accident. The fact some scenes abruptly end and other scenes just linger for what feels like forever. I hated the way this looked and felt. I have no idea what Mann's going for here, or if he's simply lost his touch as a filmmaker.Actors look either confused or bored - sometimes both - for the entire film. I have no idea what I'm supposed to care about when it comes to Enzo Ferrari as a figure. Maybe Adam Driver captured his essence well, but if so, his essence is boring and I don't know why they made a film about him. There's no real pacing or engaging build in the narrative, actors mumble their lines, and the dialogue I could make out tended to sound weirdly uninspired. Penelope Cruz felt like she was done particularly dirty by the lackluster material she was given to work with. It just felt like one boring scene after one boring scene after another boring scene.The final act is watchable and saves the film from being an outright failure. Ferrari has a stupidly high budget, but I think much of it went into capturing some of those fairly stunning race sequences. Everything else was so dull, lifeless, directionless, and shockingly amateur, though. It's a surprising mess of a film.","22 December 2023","4/10"
"Ferrari","This movie has some serious flaws...","imseeg","Definitely NOT a car movie and definitely NOT a gripping dramatic portrayal either. It's not a flop alright, but it is an awkward misfire for sure.The bad: Director Michael Mann is famous for several terrific action thrillers in the past (HEAT), but he has never excelled at making a true drama (on the contrary) and this is the exact problem with this movie, because it is severely LACKING in true drama.It's lackluster, uneventful and simply going through the motions. Almost the entire storyline is about money problems for producing racecars and lots of wife / lover quarrels / issues. What's suppose to be exciting about that?!Not even the car races (the few that were featured) were thrilling to watch. Those races didnt look bad for sure, but they werent exhilirating either. Quite average to be honest. Was this a car movie? NOPE it was NOT.What is it then? This story is entirely focussed on the CHARACTER of Mister Ferrari, played by Adam Driver. I really value this actor's performance in many other great movies, he's definitely a great actor, but he didnt nail it this time. And I am being really polite now...BEWARE: use subtitles because director Michael Mann decided to let all the ITALIAN characters speak in almost unrecognizable English with a terrible accent.

"Ferrari","Ironically Slow Given The Subject Matter","cdjh-81125","Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.","11 February 2024","5/10"
"Ferrari","A Slow, Meandering & Yawn-Inducing Sports Biopic","CinemaClown","A slow, meandering & yawn-inducing sports biopic about the Italian automotive mogul whose family name has been synonymous with speed, power & luxury, Ferrari intends to showcase the personal struggles & professional crisis of a man trying to keep his auto empire afloat only to end up halfway on both fronts. Lacking in horsepower, flat in structure, devoid of a well-oiled engine & also short of a full tank, Michael Mann's latest swerves & steers with no confidence, has no momentum or sense of direction, fails to create any adrenaline-fuelled moments even when the race is on, and is further marred by cold, distant & over-the-top performances, thus finishing as a bland & forgettable outing altogether.","1 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","A lot of missed potential","ruelshepperd","In the surface, Ferrari appears to be a well-directed, well-acted and adrenaline fuelled with excellent racing sequences. And yet, throughout the film, I couldn't help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied. This film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet I never felt attached to Enzo Ferrari and his struggles.The performances are decent overall. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed by Adam Driver as the titular character. He never showcases the great range that I know he is capable with. His Enzo Ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland. It's not helped that he is speaking English while attempting an Italian accent. If Chernobyl (2019) can get away with all English dialogue, then I feel you can do that here. It would certainly allow Driver to reach greater levels of acting. The saviour of this film is certainly Penélope Cruz. She delivers an excellent performance as Laura and I wish she got more screen time.But if you're here for the racing, the film does delivers. It's few and far between, but the third act is a long, intense race with great sound design and editing. It's a shame that you're not invested in any of the racers since the film doesn't characterise any of them. It means the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as it probably should. It's certainly shocking and brutal but it's hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the CGI is not quite great.Overall, Ferrari feels like a film that could've been better. The characters could've been better, the story could've covered a more interesting part of Enzo Ferrari's life and the acting could've been more. I left this film not feeling like I did not know Enzo Ferrari. It's a film that perhaps is not for me, but I can see how others enjoy it.","26 December 2023","8/10"
"Ferrari","Nice to have Michael Mann back","masonsaul","There are a couple films that come to mind when trying to judge how good Ferrari was. The first is ""Napoleon"". It is another biography that came out around the same time as this film. Each film needs the main character to capture the audience's interest. For both films, the dysfunctional marital relationship was a major narrative. Because of Joaquin Phoenix's legacy of gripping roles (""Joker""), he successfully embodied the main character. The film suffered for other reasons, but it kept my interest. ""Ferrari"" cast Adam Driver as the main character. I first saw Driver in ""Midnight Special"" as a quirky and interesting scientist. I really like Driver, and thought he was a good fit as the bad guy in the new Star Wars movies. However, I think someone else would have been a better fit as Ferrari. Driver doesn't exude power and leadership like the role needed. Someone who is bit older and more fits the physique. If this was made 10 years ago, someone like Christian Bale would've been a good fit.The other film I can't help but compare ""Ferrari"" to is ""Ford vs. Ferrari"". Although it came out four years prior to this film, it is recent enough to gauge what is a better film about racing. ""Ferrari"" never pretended to be about racing, it is a biography of the man. Meanwhile ""Ford vs Ferrari"" is about racing. The movie centered more on the cars than the people. In ""Ferrari"", care is taken to give many of the supporting characters some depth. The downside is that the majority of the film focuses more on the people than the machines. For that reason, I preferred ""Ford vs Ferrari"". In truth that film features very little of Ferrari other than being the rival for Ford.On the flipside, the driving scenes in the ""Ferrari"" are very dynamic without being gimmicky, and are a feast of sight and sound. The cinematography does a good job showing us vintage Italy. The dialogue could be cringe-worthy if one cared to scrutinize the Italian accents. In general, when rating this Micheal Mann film, I thought of ""Public Enemies"". That film follows John Dillinger, but has a different tone than this. Sadly, the tone here is very mild for ""Ferrari"", and the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts. This is mostly evident in the climax, in which no swelling of emotion takes place, at least not as intended. I give it a 5 out of 10.","19 December 2023","5/10"
"Ferrari","I Was Expecting More...","vengeance20","It's 1957 and Enzo Ferrari, as portrayed by Adam Driver, has a lot on his mind. His wife (Penelope Cruz) is mad with grief over the death of their son; his mistress, Shailene Woodley, wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed; he's hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed, and he's distracted by his movie-star girlfriend; and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner, which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousand-mile Mille Miglia. Also, Orsi over at Maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racers.Michael Mann is not known for character studies. His subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side, so this movie about Ferrari is a natural fit. The script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are, and they keep increasing throughout the movie, while Adam Driver lets down his guard with no one one, and Miss Cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks. I am not fond of movies about racing, since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroom-vroom sounds from their audio libraries. However, this movie makes clear that Ferrari's one real passion is racing cars, and it's a series of real crises that he has to overcome. Considering the negligible story content of so many of this year's ""For your consideration"" titles, I'll say that it's easily worth your time in the theater seat.","10 January 2024","5/10"
"Ferrari","Driver doesn't convince as the legendary Ferrari.","kgprophet","2 hours I'll never get back, I think the challenge is to see if you can stay awake for the whole film!The trailer did a good job at fooling you into thinking would be interestingAdam Driver was far too wooden and you never really felt any empathy with the character and just grew to dislike him more & more as you got to know more about him, as an advertising platform for Ferrari it failed although that wasn't its remit.Comparing this to Ford v Ferrari which had a much better script and was enjoyable to watch , this just plodded along and never really started , there was no excitement & no emotionMichael Mann had directed some great films like Heat & Collateral but this is probably his worst piece of work to date.","25 December 2023","7/10"
"Ferrari","Everyone Versus Ferrari","boblipton","Saw this at the 2023 filmfestival Ghant (Belgium). Obviously, the main topic is cars and car races, but there is also a mixture of family drama (illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir, woman with money prepared to invest, and so on) to make it compatible for family viewing. Actually, you can consider it two films, nicely intermixed with another. The car race fans will find plenty to watch, and the rest of the film moves the family story forward. Implicitly we know that the story ends well; this is no spoiler, given that the name Ferrari still exists as a car brand.Nice details in abundance. Drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate. When drivers bring their girlfriends along, the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women, to the dismay of Ferrari. He asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world, letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it, playing the cards for a business deal. And there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare, who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the company.All in all, I did not regret booking tickets, although I feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu. My fears were unjustified. There is ample family and relational drama to keep everyone's attention, and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience.","18 December 2023","4/10"

I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order. I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.","11 February 2024","5/10"
"Ferrari","A Slow, Meandering & Yawn-Inducing Sports Biopic","CinemaClown","A slow, meandering & yawn-inducing sports biopic about the Italian automotive mogul whose family name has been synonymous with speed, power & luxury, Ferrari intends to showcase the personal struggles & professional crisis of a man trying to keep his auto empire afloat only to end up halfway on both fronts. Lacking in horsepower, flat in structure, devoid of a well-oiled engine & also short of a full tank, Michael Mann's latest swerves & steers with no confidence, has no momentum or sense of direction, fails to create any adrenaline-fuelled moments even when the race is on, and is further marred by cold, distant & over-the-top performances, thus finishing as a bland & forgettable outing altogether.","1 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","A lot of missed potential","ruelshepperd","In the surface, Ferrari appears to be a well-directed, well-acted and adrenaline fuelled with excellent racing sequences. And yet, throughout the film, I couldn't help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied. This film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet I never felt attached to Enzo Ferrari and his struggles.The performances are decent overall. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed by Adam Driver as the titular character. He never showcases the great range that I know he is capable with. His Enzo Ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland. It's not helped that he is speaking English while attempting an Italian accent. If Chernobyl (2019) can get away with all English dialogue, then I feel you can do that here. It would certainly allow Driver to reach greater levels of acting. The saviour of this film is certainly Penélope Cruz. She delivers an excellent performance as Laura and I wish she got more screen time.But if you're here for the racing, the film does delivers. It's few and far between, but the third act is a long, intense race with great sound design and editing. It's a shame that you're not invested in any of the racers since the film doesn't characterise any of them. It means the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as it probably should. It's certainly shocking and brutal but it's hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the CGI is not quite great.Overall, Ferrari feels like a film that could've been better. The characters could've been better, the story could've covered a more interesting part of Enzo Ferrari's life and the acting could've been more. I left this film not feeling like I did not know Enzo Ferrari. It's a film that perhaps is not for me, but I can see how others enjoy it.","26 December 2023","8/10"
"Ferrari","Nice to have Michael Mann back","masonsaul","There are a couple films that come to mind when trying to judge how good Ferrari was. The first is ""Napoleon"". It is another biography that came out around the same time as this film. Each film needs the main character to capture the audience's interest. For both films, the dysfunctional marital relationship was a major narrative. Because of Joaquin Phoenix's legacy of gripping roles (""Joker""), he successfully embodied the main character. The film suffered for other reasons, but it kept my interest. ""Ferrari"" cast Adam Driver as the main character. I first saw Driver in ""Midnight Special"" as a quirky and interesting scientist. I really like Driver, and thought he was a good fit as the bad guy in the new Star Wars movies. However, I think someone else would have been a better fit as Ferrari. Driver doesn't exude power and leadership like the role needed. Someone who is bit older and more fits the physique. If this was made 10 years ago, someone like Christian Bale would've been a good fit.The other film I can't help but compare ""Ferrari"" to is ""Ford vs. Ferrari"". Although it came out four years prior to this film, it is recent enough to gauge what is a better film about racing. ""Ferrari"" never pretended to be about racing, it is a biography of the man. Meanwhile ""Ford vs Ferrari"" is about racing. The movie centered more on the cars than the people. In ""Ferrari"", care is taken to give many of the supporting characters some depth. The downside is that the majority of the film focuses more on the people than the machines. For that reason, I preferred ""Ford vs Ferrari"". In truth that film features very little of Ferrari other than being the rival for Ford.On the flipside, the driving scenes in the ""Ferrari"" are very dynamic without being gimmicky, and are a feast of sight and sound. The cinematography does a good job showing us vintage Italy. The dialogue could be cringe-worthy if one cared to scrutinize the Italian accents. In general, when rating this Micheal Mann film, I thought of ""Public Enemies"". That film follows John Dillinger, but has a different tone than this. Sadly, the tone here is very mild for ""Ferrari"", and the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts. This is mostly evident in the climax, in which no swelling of emotion takes place, at least not as intended. I give it a 5 out of 10.","19 December 2023","5/10"
"Ferrari","I Was Expecting More...","vengeance20","It's 1957 and Enzo Ferrari, as portrayed by Adam Driver, has a lot on his mind. His wife (Penelope Cruz) is mad with grief over the death of their son; his mistress, Shailene Woodley, wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed; he's hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed, and he's distracted by his movie-star girlfriend; and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner, which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousand-mile Mille Miglia. Also, Orsi over at Maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racers.Michael Mann is not known for character studies. His subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side, so this movie about Ferrari is a natural fit. The script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are, and they keep increasing throughout the movie, while Adam Driver lets down his guard with no one one, and Miss Cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks. I am not fond of movies about racing, since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroom-vroom sounds from their audio libraries. However, this movie makes clear that Ferrari's one real passion is racing cars, and it's a series of real crises that he has to overcome. Considering the negligible story content of so many of this year's ""For your consideration"" titles, I'll say that it's easily worth your time in the theater seat.","10 January 2024","5/10"

"Ferrari","Everyone Versus Ferrari","boblipton","Saw this at the 2023 filmfestival Ghant (Belgium). Obviously, the main topic is cars and car races, but there is also a mixture of family drama (illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir, woman with money prepared to invest, and so on) to make it compatible for family viewing. Actually, you can consider it two films, nicely intermixed with another. The car race fans will find plenty to watch, and the rest of the film moves the family story forward. Implicitly we know that the story ends well; this is no spoiler, given that the name Ferrari still exists as a car brand.Nice details in abundance. Drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate. When drivers bring their girlfriends along, the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women, to the dismay of Ferrari. He asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world, letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it, playing the cards for a business deal. And there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare, who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the company.All in all, I did not regret booking tickets, although I feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu. My fears were unjustified. There is ample family and relational drama to keep everyone's attention, and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience.","18 December 2023","4/10"
"Ferrari","Could have been a lot better","ethanbresnett","For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough.","7 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","Very disappointing","Jeremy_Urquhart","This felt sadly dreadful to me, for the most part. Ferrari is a film where it feels like very few people involved cared about what they were making. On paper, the idea to focus on one brief period of time was a good one, rather than trying to capture a single figure's life story. Adam Driver is probably my favorite actor who's risen to prominence since 2010, and Michael Mann's a filmmaker whose work I generally enjoy. The idea of them teaming up to make a movie sounded promising, but the execution here was just lifeless and strangely amateur.Much of the film's shot with a floaty, aimless camera that frames things strangely in an attempt to look unique, or because of simple incompetence; the way it sometimes shakes and drifts or zooms in and out seemingly by accident. The fact some scenes abruptly end and other scenes just linger for what feels like forever. I hated the way this looked and felt. I have no idea what Mann's going for here, or if he's simply lost his touch as a filmmaker.Actors look either confused or bored - sometimes both - for the entire film. I have no idea what I'm supposed to care about when it comes to Enzo Ferrari as a figure. Maybe Adam Driver captured his essence well, but if so, his essence is boring and I don't know why they made a film about him. There's no real pacing or engaging build in the narrative, actors mumble their lines, and the dialogue I could make out tended to sound weirdly uninspired. Penelope Cruz felt like she was done particularly dirty by the lackluster material she was given to work with. It just felt like one boring scene after one boring scene after another boring scene.The final act is watchable and saves the film from being an outright failure. Ferrari has a stupidly high budget, but I think much of it went into capturing some of those fairly stunning race sequences. Everything else was so dull, lifeless, directionless, and shockingly amateur, though. It's a surprising mess of a film.","22 December 2023","4/10"
"Ferrari","This movie has some serious flaws...","imseeg","Definitely NOT a car movie and definitely NOT a gripping dramatic portrayal either. It's not a flop alright, but it is an awkward misfire for sure.The bad: Director Michael Mann is famous for several terrific action thrillers in the past (HEAT), but he has never excelled at making a true drama (on the contrary) and this is the exact problem with this movie, because it is severely LACKING in true drama.It's lackluster, uneventful and simply going through the motions. Almost the entire storyline is about money problems for producing racecars and lots of wife / lover quarrels / issues. What's suppose to be exciting about that?!Not even the car races (the few that were featured) were thrilling to watch. Those races didnt look bad for sure, but they werent exhilirating either. Quite average to be honest. Was this a car movie? NOPE it was NOT.What is it then? This story is entirely focussed on the CHARACTER of Mister Ferrari, played by Adam Driver. I really value this actor's performance in many other great movies, he's definitely a great actor, but he didnt nail it this time. And I am being really polite now...BEWARE: use subtitles because director Michael Mann decided to let all the ITALIAN characters speak in almost unrecognizable English with a terrible accent. THAT was THE most annoying thing, that really PUT ME OFF entirely. What jibberish accents.Not a total flop, but an awkward misfire of a drama for sure...","18 December 2023","5/10"

For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre.

I was just waiting for characters to find out information I already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals could've had.I never would've guessed that Ferrari was a long time passion project for Michael Mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story. It's totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences aren't enough to save the total bore that Ferrari ended up being as a whole.","11 February 2024","5/10"
"Ferrari","A Slow, Meandering & Yawn-Inducing Sports Biopic","CinemaClown","A slow, meandering & yawn-inducing sports biopic about the Italian automotive mogul whose family name has been synonymous with speed, power & luxury, Ferrari intends to showcase the personal struggles & professional crisis of a man trying to keep his auto empire afloat only to end up halfway on both fronts. Lacking in horsepower, flat in structure, devoid of a well-oiled engine & also short of a full tank, Michael Mann's latest swerves & steers with no confidence, has no momentum or sense of direction, fails to create any adrenaline-fuelled moments even when the race is on, and is further marred by cold, distant & over-the-top performances, thus finishing as a bland & forgettable outing altogether.","1 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","A lot of missed potential","ruelshepperd","In the surface, Ferrari appears to be a well-directed, well-acted and adrenaline fuelled with excellent racing sequences. And yet, throughout the film, I couldn't help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied. This film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet I never felt attached to Enzo Ferrari and his struggles.The performances are decent overall. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed by Adam Driver as the titular character. He never showcases the great range that I know he is capable with. His Enzo Ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland. It's not helped that he is speaking English while attempting an Italian accent. If Chernobyl (2019) can get away with all English dialogue, then I feel you can do that here. It would certainly allow Driver to reach greater levels of acting. The saviour of this film is certainly Penélope Cruz. She delivers an excellent performance as Laura and I wish she got more screen time.But if you're here for the racing, the film does delivers. It's few and far between, but the third act is a long, intense race with great sound design and editing. It's a shame that you're not invested in any of the racers since the film doesn't characterise any of them. It means the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as it probably should. It's certainly shocking and brutal but it's hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the CGI is not quite great.Overall, Ferrari feels like a film that could've been better. The characters could've been better, the story could've covered a more interesting part of Enzo Ferrari's life and the acting could've been more. I left this film not feeling like I did not know Enzo Ferrari. It's a film that perhaps is not for me, but I can see how others enjoy it.","26 December 2023","8/10"
"Ferrari","Nice to have Michael Mann back","masonsaul","There are a couple films that come to mind when trying to judge how good Ferrari was. The first is ""Napoleon"". It is another biography that came out around the same time as this film. Each film needs the main character to capture the audience's interest. For both films, the dysfunctional marital relationship was a major narrative. Because of Joaquin Phoenix's legacy of gripping roles (""Joker""), he successfully embodied the main character. The film suffered for other reasons, but it kept my interest. ""Ferrari"" cast Adam Driver as the main character. I first saw Driver in ""Midnight Special"" as a quirky and interesting scientist. I really like Driver, and thought he was a good fit as the bad guy in the new Star Wars movies. However, I think someone else would have been a better fit as Ferrari. Driver doesn't exude power and leadership like the role needed. Someone who is bit older and more fits the physique. If this was made 10 years ago, someone like Christian Bale would've been a good fit.The other film I can't help but compare ""Ferrari"" to is ""Ford vs. Ferrari"". Although it came out four years prior to this film, it is recent enough to gauge what is a better film about racing. ""Ferrari"" never pretended to be about racing, it is a biography of the man. Meanwhile ""Ford vs Ferrari"" is about racing. The movie centered more on the cars than the people. In ""Ferrari"", care is taken to give many of the supporting characters some depth. The downside is that the majority of the film focuses more on the people than the machines. For that reason, I preferred ""Ford vs Ferrari"". In truth that film features very little of Ferrari other than being the rival for Ford.On the flipside, the driving scenes in the ""Ferrari"" are very dynamic without being gimmicky, and are a feast of sight and sound. The cinematography does a good job showing us vintage Italy. The dialogue could be cringe-worthy if one cared to scrutinize the Italian accents. In general, when rating this Micheal Mann film, I thought of ""Public Enemies"". That film follows John Dillinger, but has a different tone than this. Sadly, the tone here is very mild for ""Ferrari"", and the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts. This is mostly evident in the climax, in which no swelling of emotion takes place, at least not as intended. I give it a 5 out of 10.","19 December 2023","5/10"
"Ferrari","I Was Expecting More...","vengeance20","It's 1957 and Enzo Ferrari, as portrayed by Adam Driver, has a lot on his mind. His wife (Penelope Cruz) is mad with grief over the death of their son; his mistress, Shailene Woodley, wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed; he's hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed, and he's distracted by his movie-star girlfriend; and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner, which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousand-mile Mille Miglia. Also, Orsi over at Maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racers.Michael Mann is not known for character studies. His subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side, so this movie about Ferrari is a natural fit. The script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are, and they keep increasing throughout the movie, while Adam Driver lets down his guard with no one one, and Miss Cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks. I am not fond of movies about racing, since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroom-vroom sounds from their audio libraries. However, this movie makes clear that Ferrari's one real passion is racing cars, and it's a series of real crises that he has to overcome. Considering the negligible story content of so many of this year's ""For your consideration"" titles, I'll say that it's easily worth your time in the theater seat.","10 January 2024","5/10"

"Ferrari","Everyone Versus Ferrari","boblipton","Saw this at the 2023 filmfestival Ghant (Belgium). Obviously, the main topic is cars and car races, but there is also a mixture of family drama (illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir, woman with money prepared to invest, and so on) to make it compatible for family viewing. Actually, you can consider it two films, nicely intermixed with another. The car race fans will find plenty to watch, and the rest of the film moves the family story forward. Implicitly we know that the story ends well; this is no spoiler, given that the name Ferrari still exists as a car brand.Nice details in abundance. Drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate. When drivers bring their girlfriends along, the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women, to the dismay of Ferrari. He asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world, letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it, playing the cards for a business deal. And there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare, who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the company.All in all, I did not regret booking tickets, although I feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu. My fears were unjustified. There is ample family and relational drama to keep everyone's attention, and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience.","18 December 2023","4/10"
"Ferrari","Could have been a lot better","ethanbresnett","For a film helmed by Michael Mann and starring Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz, I was expecting a lot more from this.By the end, I didn't feel like I was much closer to Enzo Ferrari or his wife. I didn't come away with much more of an understanding or appreciation of the racing element. I didn't feel overly thrilled or engaged.This all sounds a bit negative, but that's not to say there aren't positives to this film. Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz are really strong, even if they don't peel back the layers of the characters enough for me. However this is more of a criticism of the script than the performances. The racing scenes are well executed although could be a little more exciting and perhaps even shot a little better. Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces. It probably didn't help that the pacing of this film was totally off, feeling much longer than it actually is, which reduced the impact of some of these scenes.Overall I think this is a film of what could have been. There's an interesting story and an interesting man at the heart of all of this, but it just wasn't teased out enough.","7 January 2024","6/10"
"Ferrari","Very disappointing","Jeremy_Urquhart","This felt sadly dreadful to me, for the most part. Ferrari is a film where it feels like very few people involved cared about what they were making. On paper, the idea to focus on one brief period of time was a good one, rather than trying to capture a single figure's life story. Adam Driver is probably my favorite actor who's risen to prominence since 2010, and Michael Mann's a filmmaker whose work I generally enjoy. The idea of them teaming up to make a movie sounded promising, but the execution here was just lifeless and strangely amateur.Much of the film's shot with a floaty, aimless camera that frames things strangely in an attempt to look unique, or because of simple incompetence; the way it sometimes shakes and drifts or zooms in and out seemingly by accident. The fact some scenes abruptly end and other scenes just linger for what feels like forever. I hated the way this looked and felt. I have no idea what Mann's going for here, or if he's simply lost his touch as a filmmaker.Actors look either confused or bored - sometimes both - for the entire film. I have no idea what I'm supposed to care about when it comes to Enzo Ferrari as a figure. Maybe Adam Driver captured his essence well, but if so, his essence is boring and I don't know why they made a film about him. There's no real pacing or engaging build in the narrative, actors mumble their lines, and the dialogue I could make out tended to sound weirdly uninspired. Penelope Cruz felt like she was done particularly dirty by the lackluster material she was given to work with. It just felt like one boring scene after one boring scene after another boring scene.The final act is watchable and saves the film from being an outright failure. Ferrari has a stupidly high budget, but I think much of it went into capturing some of those fairly stunning race sequences. Everything else was so dull, lifeless, directionless, and shockingly amateur, though. It's a surprising mess of a film.","22 December 2023","4/10"
"Ferrari","This movie has some serious flaws...","imseeg","Definitely NOT a car movie and definitely NOT a gripping dramatic portrayal either. It's not a flop alright, but it is an awkward misfire for sure.The bad: Director Michael Mann is famous for several terrific action thrillers in the past (HEAT), but he has never excelled at making a true drama (on the contrary) and this is the exact problem with this movie, because it is severely LACKING in true drama.It's lackluster, uneventful and simply going through the motions. Almost the entire storyline is about money problems for producing racecars and lots of wife / lover quarrels / issues. What's suppose to be exciting about that?!Not even the car races (the few that were featured) were thrilling to watch. Those races didnt look bad for sure, but they werent exhilirating either. Quite average to be honest. Was this a car movie? NOPE it was NOT.What is it then? This story is entirely focussed on the CHARACTER of Mister Ferrari, played by Adam Driver. I really value this actor's performance in many other great movies, he's definitely a great actor, but he didnt nail it this time. And I am being really polite now...BEWARE: use subtitles because director Michael Mann decided to let all the ITALIAN characters speak in almost unrecognizable English with a terrible accent. THAT was THE most annoying thing, that really PUT ME OFF entirely. What jibberish accents.Not a total flop, but an awkward misfire of a drama for sure...","18 December 2023","5/10"
"Ferrari","Ironically Slow Given The Subject Matter","cdjh-81125","Ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what should've been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure. The performances might be solid and there's an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat. This filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter should've amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did. For as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be I have to say I found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and done.The whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing I would've expected for a director of Michael Mann's calibre. Mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction. From almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum. The scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are they're too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being. All the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shot/reverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me. There's an extremely effective moment in the 3rd act that felt like Mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for me.The script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character. Adam Driver is solid in the role as Enzo Ferrari, though I wouldn't rate it as one of his best performances, but I never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling. It's established early on that Ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character. I didn't think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result I just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations I didn't find to be that interesting. There's a love triangle that's set up with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley's characters that almost felt like it should've been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time. Driver and Cruz have good chemistry but I never really thought that Mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition that's given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order.
