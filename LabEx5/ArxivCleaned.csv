"a step towards the integration of machine learning and small area estimation","tomasz żądło, adam chwila","methodology","the use of machine-learning techniques has grown in numerous research areas. currently, it is also widely used in statistics, including the official statistics for data collection (e.g. satellite imagery, web scraping and text mining, data cleaning, integration and imputation) but also for data analysis. however, the usage of these methods in survey sampling including small area estimation is still very limited. therefore, we propose a predictor supported by these algorithms which can be used to predict any population or subpopulation characteristics based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data. machine learning methods have already been shown to be very powerful in identifying and modelling complex and nonlinear relationships between the variables, which means that they have very good properties in case of strong departures from the classic assumptions. therefore, we analyse the performance of our proposal under a different set-up, in our opinion of greater importance in real-life surveys. we study only small departures from the assumed model, to show that our proposal is a good alternative in this case as well, even in comparison with optimal methods under the model. what is more, we propose the method of the accuracy estimation of machine learning predictors, giving the possibility of the accuracy comparison with classic methods, where the accuracy is measured as in survey sampling practice. the solution of this problem is indicated in the literature as one of the key issues in integration of these approaches. the simulation studies are based on a real, longitudinal dataset, freely available from the polish local data bank, where the prediction problem of subpopulation characteristics in the last period, with ""borrowing strength"" from other subpopulations and time periods, is considered.",2024-02-12

"a scalable and automated framework for tracking the likely adoption of emerging technologies","lowri williams, eirini anthi, pete burnap","computers and society","while new technologies are expected to revolutionise and become game-changers in improving the efficiencies and practises of our daily lives, it is also critical to investigate and understand the barriers and opportunities faced by their adopters. such findings can serve as an additional feature in the decision-making process when analysing the risks, costs, and benefits of adopting an emerging technology in a particular setting. although several studies have attempted to perform such investigations, these approaches adopt a qualitative data collection methodology which is limited in terms of the size of the targeted participant group and is associated with a significant manual overhead when transcribing and inferring results. this paper presents a scalable and automated framework for tracking likely adoption and/or rejection of new technologies from a large landscape of adopters. in particular, a large corpus of social media texts containing references to emerging technologies was compiled. text mining techniques were applied to extract sentiments expressed towards technology aspects. in the context of the problem definition herein, we hypothesise that the expression of positive sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting a technology user's acceptance to adopt, integrate, and/or use the technology, and negative sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting the rejection of emerging technologies by adopters. to quantitatively test our hypothesis, a ground truth analysis was performed to validate that the sentiment captured by the text mining approach is comparable to the results given by human annotators when asked to label whether such texts positively or negatively impact their outlook towards adopting an emerging technology.",2024-01-16
"building contextual knowledge graphs for personalized learning recommendations using text mining and semantic graph completion","hasan abu-rasheed, mareike dornhöfer, christian weber, gábor kismihók, ulrike buchmann, madjid fathi","information retrieval","modelling learning objects (lo) within their context enables the learner to advance from a basic, remembering-level, learning objective to a higher-order one, i.e., a level with an application- and analysis objective. while hierarchical data models are commonly used in digital learning platforms, using graph-based models enables representing the context of los in those platforms. this leads to a foundation for personalized recommendations of learning paths. in this paper, the transformation of hierarchical data models into knowledge graph (kg) models of los using text mining is introduced and evaluated. we utilize custom text mining pipelines to mine semantic relations between elements of an expert-curated hierarchical model. we evaluate the kg structure and relation extraction using graph quality-control metrics and the comparison of algorithmic semantic-similarities to expert-defined ones. the results show that the relations in the kg are semantically comparable to those defined by domain experts, and that the proposed kg improves representing and linking the contexts of los through increasing graph communities and betweenness centrality.",2024-01-24
"topic modelling: going beyond token outputs","lowri williams, eirini anthi, laura arman, pete burnap","computation and language","topic modelling is a text mining technique for identifying salient themes from a number of documents. the output is commonly a set of topics consisting of isolated tokens that often co-occur in such documents. manual effort is often associated with interpreting a topic's description from such tokens. however, from a human's perspective, such outputs may not adequately provide enough information to infer the meaning of the topics; thus, their interpretability is often inaccurately understood. although several studies have attempted to automatically extend topic descriptions as a means of enhancing the interpretation of topic models, they rely on external language sources that may become unavailable, must be kept up-to-date to generate relevant results, and present privacy issues when training on or processing data. this paper presents a novel approach towards extending the output of traditional topic modelling methods beyond a list of isolated tokens. this approach removes the dependence on external sources by using the textual data itself by extracting high-scoring keywords and mapping them to the topic model's token outputs. to measure the interpretability of the proposed outputs against those of the traditional topic modelling approach, independent annotators manually scored each output based on their quality and usefulness, as well as the efficiency of the annotation task. the proposed approach demonstrated higher quality and usefulness, as well as higher efficiency in the annotation task, in comparison to the outputs of a traditional topic modelling method, demonstrating an increase in their interpretability.",2024-01-16

"two directions for clinical data generation with large language models: data-to-label and label-to-data","rumeng li, xun wang, hong yu","computation and language","large language models (llms) can generate natural language texts for various domains and tasks, but their potential for clinical text mining, a domain with scarce, sensitive, and imbalanced medical data, is underexplored. we investigate whether llms can augment clinical data for detecting alzheimer's disease (ad)-related signs and symptoms from electronic health records (ehrs), a challenging task that requires high expertise. we create a novel pragmatic taxonomy for ad sign and symptom progression based on expert knowledge, which guides llms to generate synthetic data following two different directions: ""data-to-label"", which labels sentences from a public ehr collection with ad-related signs and symptoms; and ""label-to-data"", which generates sentences with ad-related signs and symptoms based on the label definition. we train a system to detect ad-related signs and symptoms from ehrs, using three datasets: (1) a gold dataset annotated by human experts on longitudinal ehrs of ad patients; (2) a silver dataset created by the data-to-label method; and (3) a bronze dataset created by the label-to-data method. we find that using the silver and bronze datasets improves the system performance, outperforming the system using only the gold dataset. this shows that llms can generate synthetic clinical data for a complex task by incorporating expert knowledge, and our label-to-data method can produce datasets that are free of sensitive information, while maintaining acceptable quality.",2023-12-09
"exact representation and efficient approximations of linear model predictive control laws via hardtanh type deep neural networks","daniela lupu, ion necoara","optimization and control","deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields, including image processing, inverse problems, text mining and more recently, give very promising results in systems and control. neural networks with hidden layers have a strong potential as an approximation framework of predictive control laws as they usually yield better approximation quality and smaller memory requirements than existing explicit (multi-parametric) approaches. in this paper, we first show that neural networks with hardtanh activation functions can exactly represent predictive control laws of linear time-invariant systems. we derive theoretical bounds on the minimum number of hidden layers and neurons that a hardtanh neural network should have to exactly represent a given predictive control law. the choice of hardtanh deep neural networks is particularly suited for linear predictive control laws as they usually require less hidden layers and neurons than deep neural networks with relu units for representing exactly continuous piecewise affine (or equivalently min-max) maps. in the second part of the paper we bring the physics of the model and standard optimization techniques into the architecture design, in order to eliminate the disadvantages of the black-box hardtanh learning. more specifically, we design trainable unfolded hardtanh deep architectures for learning linear predictive control laws based on two standard iterative optimization algorithms, i.e., projected gradient descent and accelerated projected gradient descent. we also study the performance of the proposed hardtanh type deep neural networks on a linear model predictive control application.",2024-01-10

"language model as an annotator: unsupervised context-aware quality phrase generation","zhihao zhang, yuan zuo, chenghua lin, junjie wu","computation and language","phrase mining is a fundamental text mining task that aims to identify quality phrases from context. nevertheless, the scarcity of extensive gold labels datasets, demanding substantial annotation efforts from experts, renders this task exceptionally challenging. furthermore, the emerging, infrequent, and domain-specific nature of quality phrases presents further challenges in dealing with this task. in this paper, we propose lmphrase, a novel unsupervised context-aware quality phrase mining framework built upon large pre-trained language models (lms). specifically, we first mine quality phrases as silver labels by employing a parameter-free probing technique called perturbed masking on the pre-trained language model bert (coined as annotator). in contrast to typical statistic-based or distantly-supervised methods, our silver labels, derived from large pre-trained language models, take into account rich contextual information contained in the lms. as a result, they bring distinct advantages in preserving informativeness, concordance, and completeness of quality phrases. secondly, training a discriminative span prediction model heavily relies on massive annotated data and is likely to face the risk of overfitting silver labels. alternatively, we formalize phrase tagging task as the sequence generation problem by directly fine-tuning on the sequence-to-sequence pre-trained language model bart with silver labels (coined as generator). finally, we merge the quality phrases from both the annotator and generator as the final predictions, considering their complementary nature and distinct characteristics. extensive experiments show that our lmphrase consistently outperforms all the existing competitors across two different granularity phrase mining tasks, where each task is tested on two different domain datasets.",2023-12-28
"efficient high-quality clustering for large bipartite graphs","renchi yang, jieming shi","social and information networks","a bipartite graph contains inter-set edges between two disjoint vertex sets, and is widely used to model real-world data, such as user-item purchase records, author-article publications, and biological interactions between drugs and proteins. k-bipartite graph clustering (k-bgc) is to partition the target vertex set in a bipartite graph into k disjoint clusters. the clustering quality is important to the utility of k-bgc in various applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, text mining, and bioinformatics, to name a few. existing approaches to k-bgc either output clustering results with compromised quality due to inadequate exploitation of high-order information between vertices, or fail to handle sizable bipartite graphs with billions of edges. motivated by this, this paper presents two efficient k-bgc solutions, hope and hope+, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale bipartite graphs. hope obtains high scalability and effectiveness through a new k-bgc problem formulation based on the novel notion of high-order perspective (hop) vectors and an efficient technique for low-rank approximation of hop vectors. hope+ further elevates the k-bgc performance to another level with a judicious problem transformation and a highly efficient two-stage optimization framework. two variants, hope+ (fnem) and hope+ (snem) are designed when either the frobenius norm or spectral norm is applied in the transformation. extensive experiments, comparing hope and hope+ against 13 competitors on 10 real-world datasets, exhibit that our solutions, especially hope+, are superior to existing methods in terms of result quality, while being up to orders of magnitude faster. on the largest dataset mag with 1.1 billion edges, hope+ is able to produce clusters with the highest clustering accuracy within 31 minutes, which is unmatched by any existing solution for k-bgc.",2023-12-28
"debiasing sample loadings and scores in exponential family pca for sparse count data","ruochen huang, yoonkyung lee","methodology","multivariate count data with many zeros frequently occur in a variety of application areas such as text mining with a document-term matrix and cluster analysis with microbiome abundance data. exponential family pca (collins et al., 2001) is a widely used dimension reduction tool to understand and capture the underlying low-rank structure of count data. it produces principal component scores by fitting poisson regression models with estimated loadings as covariates. this tends to result in extreme scores for sparse count data significantly deviating from true scores. we consider two major sources of bias in this estimation procedure and propose ways to reduce their effects. first, the discrepancy between true loadings and their estimates under a limited sample size largely degrades the quality of score estimates. by treating estimated loadings as covariates with bias and measurement errors, we debias score estimates, using the iterative bootstrap method for loadings and considering classical measurement error models. second, the existence of mle bias is often ignored in score estimation, but this bias could be removed through well-known mle bias reduction methods. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bias correction procedure through experiments on both simulated data and real data.",2023-12-20

"in nomine patris... elements for a semantics of medieval paternity","nicolas perreaux (lamop)","digital libraries","this article examines medieval concepts of paternity and father-son relationships through the digital analysis of medieval textual corpora. although historians have access to enormous digital collections in 2023, they have rarely fully exploited these resources. the author proposes a historical semantic approach to this theme, using modeling tools and text mining in general, to analyze the evolution of terms related to paternity. the study proposes three conclusions: 1. a semantic break occurred in the semantic field of paternity at the turn of antiquity and the early middle ages. the meaning of pater and its derivatives changed radically over the course of the 4th-6th centuries, particularly as a result of the influence of the dogma of the christian trinity. medieval fatherhood was multidimensional, encompassing both biological and spiritual aspects, in other words, complex relationships between multiple carnal and spiritual (i.e. divine) fathers. 2. the role of spiritual kinship is crucial to understanding medieval fatherhood, as the work of anita guerreau-jalabert and j{é}r{ô}me baschet has already shown. initially attributed to god, this ''ideal paternity'' (paternitas) gradually extended to members of the church (popes, bishops, abbots), underlining at the same time the growing importance of spiritual kinship over biological kinship over the centuries studied. 3. to reveal these structures, invisible to the naked eye, an interdisciplinary approach is rigorously required. complementary investigations into the lemmas mater, filia, frater and other family terms are required. the use of digital tools and historical semantic analysis opens up new perspectives for researchers in history, anthropology, linguistics and data mining, enabling them to explore the representation systems of ancient societies in depth and with nuance.",2023-10-06

"understanding finetuning for factual knowledge extraction from language models","mehran kazemi, sid mittal, deepak ramachandran","computation and language","language models (lms) pretrained on large corpora of text from the web have been observed to contain large amounts of various types of knowledge about the world. this observation has led to a new and exciting paradigm in knowledge graph construction where, instead of manual curation or text mining, one extracts knowledge from the parameters of an lm. recently, it has been shown that finetuning lms on a set of factual knowledge makes them produce better answers to queries from a different set, thus making finetuned lms a good candidate for knowledge extraction and, consequently, knowledge graph construction. in this paper, we analyze finetuned lms for factual knowledge extraction. we show that along with its previously known positive effects, finetuning also leads to a (potentially harmful) phenomenon which we call frequency shock, where at the test time the model over-predicts rare entities that appear in the training set and under-predicts common entities that do not appear in the training set enough times. we show that frequency shock leads to a degradation in the predictions of the model and beyond a point, the harm from frequency shock can even outweigh the positive effects of finetuning, making finetuning harmful overall. we then consider two solutions to remedy the identified negative effect: 1- model mixing and 2- mixture finetuning with the lm's pre-training task. the two solutions combined lead to significant improvements compared to vanilla finetuning.",2023-01-26

"clustop: an unsupervised and integrated text clustering and topic extraction framework","zhongtao chen, chenghu mi, siwei duo, jingfei he, yatong zhou","computation and language","text clustering and topic extraction are two important tasks in text mining. usually, these two tasks are performed separately. for topic extraction to facilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then perform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. to promote topic extraction by clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and then extract cluster-specific topics. however, this naive strategy ignores the fact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and follow a chicken-and-egg relationship. performing them separately fails to make them mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. in this paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction framework (clustop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into a unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract topics from each cluster simultaneously. our framework includes four components: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction, clustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be viewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. on one hand, it provides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates effective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the topic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention architecture. moreover, the training of enhanced language model is unsupervised. experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide benchmarks for different model combinations in this framework.",2023-01-03

"can current explainability help provide references in clinical notes to support humans annotate medical codes?","byung-hak kim, zhongfen deng, philip s. yu, varun ganapathi","machine learning","the medical codes prediction problem from clinical notes has received substantial interest in the nlp community, and several recent studies have shown the state-of-the-art (sota) code prediction results of full-fledged deep learning-based methods. however, most previous sota works based on deep learning are still in early stages in terms of providing textual references and explanations of the predicted codes, despite the fact that this level of explainability of the prediction outcomes is critical to gaining trust from professional medical coders. this raises the important question of how well current explainability methods apply to advanced neural network models such as transformers to predict correct codes and present references in clinical notes that support code prediction. first, we present an explainable read, attend, and code (xrac) framework and assess two approaches, attention score-based xrac-attn and model-agnostic knowledge-distillation-based xrac-kd, through simplified but thorough human-grounded evaluations with sota transformer-based model, rac. we find that the supporting evidence text highlighted by xrac-attn is of higher quality than xrac-kd whereas xrac-kd has potential advantages in production deployment scenarios. more importantly, we show for the first time that, given the current state of explainability methodologies, using the sota medical codes prediction system still requires the expertise and competencies of professional coders, even though its prediction accuracy is superior to that of human coders. this, we believe, is a very meaningful step toward developing explainable and accurate machine learning systems for fully autonomous medical code prediction from clinical notes.",2022-10-28
"machine and deep learning methods with manual and automatic labelling for news classification in bangla language","istiak ahmad, fahad alqurashi, rashid mehmood","artificial intelligence","research in natural language processing (nlp) has increasingly become important due to applications such as text classification, text mining, sentiment analysis, pos tagging, named entity recognition, textual entailment, and many others. this paper introduces several machine and deep learning methods with manual and automatic labelling for news classification in the bangla language. we implemented several machine (ml) and deep learning (dl) algorithms. the ml algorithms are logistic regression (lr), stochastic gradient descent (sgd), support vector machine (svm), random forest (rf), and k-nearest neighbour (knn), used with bag of words (bow), term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), and doc2vec embedding models. the dl algorithms are long short-term memory (lstm), bidirectional lstm (bilstm), gated recurrent unit (gru), and convolutional neural network (cnn), used with word2vec, glove, and fasttext word embedding models. we develop automatic labelling methods using latent dirichlet allocation (lda) and investigate the performance of single-label and multi-label article classification methods. to investigate performance, we developed from scratch potrika, the largest and the most extensive dataset for news classification in the bangla language, comprising 185.51 million words and 12.57 million sentences contained in 664,880 news articles in eight distinct categories, curated from six popular online news portals in bangladesh for the period 2014-2020. gru and fasttext with 91.83% achieve the highest accuracy for manually-labelled data. for the automatic labelling case, knn and doc2vec at 57.72% and 75% achieve the highest accuracy for single-label and multi-label data, respectively. the methods developed in this paper are expected to advance research in bangla and other languages.",2022-10-19

"hapi: a large-scale longitudinal dataset of commercial ml api predictions","lingjiao chen, zhihua jin, sabri eyuboglu, christopher ré, matei zaharia, james zou","software engineering","commercial ml apis offered by providers such as google, amazon and microsoft have dramatically simplified ml adoption in many applications. numerous companies and academics pay to use ml apis for tasks such as object detection, ocr and sentiment analysis. different ml apis tackling the same task can have very heterogeneous performance. moreover, the ml models underlying the apis also evolve over time. as ml apis rapidly become a valuable marketplace and a widespread way to consume machine learning, it is critical to systematically study and compare different apis with each other and to characterize how apis change over time. however, this topic is currently underexplored due to the lack of data. in this paper, we present hapi (history of apis), a longitudinal dataset of 1,761,417 instances of commercial ml api applications (involving apis from amazon, google, ibm, microsoft and other providers) across diverse tasks including image tagging, speech recognition and text mining from 2020 to 2022. each instance consists of a query input for an api (e.g., an image or text) along with the api's output prediction/annotation and confidence scores. hapi is the first large-scale dataset of ml api usages and is a unique resource for studying ml-as-a-service (mlaas). as examples of the types of analyses that hapi enables, we show that ml apis' performance change substantially over time--several apis' accuracies dropped on specific benchmark datasets. even when the api's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift across different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. such changes can substantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ml api as a component. we further use hapi to study commercial apis' performance disparities across demographic subgroups over time. hapi can stimulate more research in the growing field of mlaas.",2022-09-18

"twitter attribute classification with q-learning on bitcoin price prediction","sattarov otabek, jaeyoung choi","social and information networks","aspiring to achieve an accurate bitcoin price prediction based on people's opinions on twitter usually requires millions of tweets, using different text mining techniques (preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, stop word removal), and developing a machine learning model to perform the prediction. these attempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power, central processing unit (cpu) utilization, random-access memory (ram) usage, and time. to address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of tweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage levels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. to classify tweet attributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all bitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four categories based on the following tweet attributes: $(i)$ the number of followers of the tweet poster, $(ii)$ the number of comments on the tweet, $(iii)$ the number of likes, and $(iv)$ the number of retweets. we separately train and test by using the q-learning model with the above four categorized sets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. especially, we design several reward functions to improve the prediction accuracy of the q-leaning. we compare our approach with a classic approach where all bitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the cpu workloads, ram usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. the results show that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most influence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80\% less time, 88.8\% less cpu consumption, and 12.5\% more accurate predictions compared with the classic approach.",2022-08-04

"joint learning-based causal relation extraction from biomedical literature","dongling li, pengchao wu, yuehu dong, jinghang gu, longhua qian, guodong zhou","computation and language","causal relation extraction of biomedical entities is one of the most complex tasks in biomedical text mining, which involves two kinds of information: entity relations and entity functions. one feasible approach is to take relation extraction and function detection as two independent sub-tasks. however, this separate learning method ignores the intrinsic correlation between them and leads to unsatisfactory performance. in this paper, we propose a joint learning model, which combines entity relation extraction and entity function detection to exploit their commonality and capture their inter-relationship, so as to improve the performance of biomedical causal relation extraction. meanwhile, during the model training stage, different function types in the loss function are assigned different weights. specifically, the penalty coefficient for negative function instances increases to effectively improve the precision of function detection. experimental results on the biocreative-v track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model outperforms the separate models in bel statement extraction, achieving the f1 scores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in stage 2 and stage 1 evaluations, respectively. this demonstrates that our joint learning system reaches the state-of-the-art performance in stage 2 compared with other systems.",2022-08-02

"learning from what we know: how to perform vulnerability prediction using noisy historical data","aayush garg, renzo degiovanni, matthieu jimenez, maxime cordy, mike papadakis, yves letraon","software engineering","vulnerability prediction refers to the problem of identifying system components that are most likely to be vulnerable. typically, this problem is tackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. unfortunately, recent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the following two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the inherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered much later than they are introduced. this misleads classifiers as they learn to recognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. to tackle these issues, we propose trovon, a technique that learns from known vulnerable components rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as typically performed. we perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and their respective fixed components. this way, trovon manages to learn from the things we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and unbalanced data. we evaluate trovon by comparing it with existing techniques on three security-critical open source systems, i.e., linux kernel, openssl, and wireshark, with historical vulnerabilities that have been reported in the national vulnerability database (nvd). our evaluation demonstrates that the prediction capability of trovon significantly outperforms existing vulnerability prediction techniques such as software metrics, imports, function calls, text mining, devign, lstm, and lstm-rf with an improvement of 40.84% in matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) score under clean training data settings, and an improvement of 35.52% under realistic training data settings.",2022-07-22
