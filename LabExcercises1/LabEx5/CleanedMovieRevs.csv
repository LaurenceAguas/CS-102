"killers of the flower moon","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA
"killers of the flower moon","touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","mrdhwong","some films warrant long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the

"killers of the flower moon","killers of my patience","medjasta","the story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the osage nation for their bountiful oil wealth in s oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until martin scorsese decided to make his killers of the flower moon a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold detached and disarrayed but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some leonardo dicaprio is cast jarringly against type as ernest a cowardly quasi wwii vet who is pressured by his amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro into marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock much of the film is distressing in the sense that we the audience know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with ernest and mollie i saw an interview with scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming backstabbing and psychopathic doublecrossing of his urban crime sagas but in a far wilder more rural and spatially wide open locale he further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way and what that might look like onscreen thematically well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled pun intended machine here because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse its in that second part the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here only lily gladstone who undeniably gives the films best performance is really up to the task imbuing mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant angelic poise that is utterly captivating but shes marooned in a tempest of misguided choices missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis ive read the backstory of this film and how scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the fbis eventual involvement they were ultimately sadly too little too late here and towards a deliberate focus on the osage their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil well he doesnt really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages roundtable elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume there is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that if they could see their enemy they would kill them but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them really from a narrative standpoint its pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them mollie especially look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didnt ring true for me she is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by gladstone but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like ernest rife with red flags from the outset i might add is something that scorsese frustratingly sidesteps stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural i cant help but wonder if this story meant to be told from the perspective of the osage may have been better off in other more edgy and esoteric hands",2023-10-19,NA

"killers of the flower moon","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the

"killers of the flower moon","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

"killers of the flower moon","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite its stellar cinematography evocative score and a few powerful performances martin scorseses killers of the flower moon is an underwhelming disappointment",2023-10-22,NA

possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA
"killers of the flower moon","touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","mrdhwong","some films warrant long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite its stellar cinematography evocative score and a few powerful performances martin scorseses killers of the flower moon is an underwhelming disappointment",2023-10-22,NA

"killers of the flower moon","somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","i strongly recommend reading the book over the film its clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can but that is not whats wrong here i would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book except with certain chronological order of events the problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience especially how the events unfolded i dont understand scoreses decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away whos behind it all we dont even get a solid character study since dicaprios character and performance is onedimensional so is deniros unfortunately you have this back and forth between these two characters and its always the same dynamic even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming one good thing i can say is that the movie doesnt feel like three and a half hours although the first hour is clearly the best part with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit due to its repetitive nature choosing to tell the story from a perpetrators point of view felt like a safe choice scorese has done this before and much better i might add  there are several cross cuts upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material a few nice visual ideas here and there cant breathe life into a drab screenplay one of the best parts of the book was the investigation of tom white into the murders which was a true herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification whereas the movie zaps through it and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this the book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals which the movie simply failed to portray properly the end coda with the lucky strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience all it did for me was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie the assassination of jessie james by the coward bob ford where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play i think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like andrew dominic but i still commend scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of american history",2023-10-22,NA

directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother

"madame web (2024)","i am filled with hatred it cant get any worse","olcare","first impressionthe opening of the madame web was immersed in a mystique and ambition enhanced by great musical score yet as the movie progresses it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotionsthe positivemusical score and sound design the standout feature of madame web is its musical score the soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps the sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans bass and reverse effects it creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the films strongest featuresthe mixedvisual effects and costume design some of the visual effects in madame web were visually appealing the costume design like caseys red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the films aesthetic but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different i was disappointedacting and direction although i thought caseys character development  her ability to see the world from a different perspective  was great i didnt like how it was visually presented the way it was edited was poorly done the editor could use  distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two she sees the present momenthowever the performances throughout the film feel lackluster with the actors appearing confused and disengaged this combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes significantly undermines the films potentialnegativescinematography cinematography is bad since some pictures dont show a clear image the camera moves so fast that i cannot comprehend the picture i kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spiders eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision the cinematography is not something like wow the reason why cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch i found the  degree round camera rotations super cool but again i expected varied distance shots not just medium shots the train scene cinematography was the best in the filmediting and pace the editing is arguably the weakest element of madame web with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling this lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrativeplot and overall execution the storyline of madame web is cluttered and clichd suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction the films ambition is evident but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrativethe conclusionmadame web presents a paradoxical experience with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing cinematography and directionalthough there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarityalso i think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a tv series which would have allowed for a more indepth exploration of characters and plotnevertheless madame web is a bit of a mixed bag with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visuallyrating ",2024-02-21,NA
"madame web (2024)","a massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","madame web is a new spinoff set in the marvel spiderman world this spinoff is directed partly written and produced by s j clarkson before this film she directed more tv series episodes of superhero shows such as jessica jones and the defenderscassandra webb dakota johnson works as a paramedic in new york and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities she sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spiderlike powersthis is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger to truly protect them they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work togetherthe story of this film has an interesting concept but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers these writers do not always seem to have been on the same page because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed it sometimes seems as if they didnt really know what exactly to do with it or what the film studio despised of them the screenplay has also been rewritten many times so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the filmdespite these messy rushed aspects the film remains on a familiar predictable side for a superhero film this can make the film seem a bit longwinded or embarrassing the film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year  but of a somewhat lesser qualitythe visual effects dont always look believable either the blue screen and cgi can be seen in the film for some of the cast members this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects the fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their actingthe poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles dakota johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film or ignorant of how to properly promote this film in the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role but she doesnt always get the chance to do this sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor play the three girls cassandra tries to protect all three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three for a better focused film they might have been better off using a character in the story who cassandra then has to protect tahar rahim plays the villain in the film who tries to kill the three girls but also deals with the poor weak script as a result he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story they also didnt incorporate his audio work well into the film because his lips sometimes dont always match what his character is sayingwith all these superhero spinoff films from the sony film studio they only make marvels current film series more messy if sony and disney marvel try to collaborate on the same film series they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series",2024-02-20,NA

"constellation (2024)","here is the premise","jackbaumel","i wasnt entirely sure where the show was headed when early reviewers and synopsis described it as a show about an astronaut who returns to earth to find it different through subtle and not so subtle scenes the story builds its plot device on quantum physics for dummies to weave a story where two events can happen or not happen and happen and not happen at the same time understandably this can be confusing to follow and a good review and a bad one can coexist and both could be rightas with most interesting mysteries there are secrets being kept that will be revealed the show incorporates scifi horror elements such as darkness screams imagery of the dead and the terror of the unknown the main premise seems that those who went out to space and back no longer experience reality as a certainty in the quantum physical sensethe acting is fine though a bit uneven but in retrospect this could be due to the way the story develops nonlinearly at certain points but the suspense does start to build up by the third episode and there is enough there to make me speculate on whats going on some may need to suspend a little disbelief early on on how the entire iss can be rendered so useless by one impact as if the minds of multiple space agencies havent planned for myriad contingencies module and system isolation and redundancy etc but its realistic enough to get the story goingthis appears to be a decent scifi horror suspense thriller in the making and maintains apple tvs standard for production quality i do hope there is more to this than hollywoods literal take on einsteins spooky action at a distance",2024-02-22,NA

"constellation (2024)","maybe you dont get it","rlilgeberg","at the end of the first episode i actually thought that i had watched the first two episodes until i checked and saw it was only the first that first one hour episode seriously seemed like two hours of timethe story premise is really compelling and there are bits of story along the way of the first three episodes i watched that really reward you for sticking with it but theres no doubt that either the person who directed the first episodes is trying to mess with the viewers sense of timing or they just dont know how to direct or edit or someone doesntso i kept getting this feeling like why does this seem to constantly be dragging on and on im normally very patient with a good story then in the second episode when jos capsule lands i realized that i spent a full three and a half minutes watching her unbuckle her seat belt and begin to get out of the capsule three and a half minutes thats an eternity for a scene that should have taken maybe a minute max before that scene when shes sending messages to her family that she loves them i noticed it was almost like she was dragging out the lines and repeating feelings two three even four times like it was bizarrely written acted directed or all three i could literally see jo pausing briefly between words seemingly for emotional effect like she was directed to do that there were scenes when jo is reunited with her family where they were so awkwardly long that i found myself wondering if they were acting awkward toward jo or if the scene was just so long that i was reading too much into what i saw in their acting like is alice actually being awkward around jo or is the actress playing alice just standing there trying to act like shes supposed to be standing there staring coollythe other strange part about this show is i had to turn on the english subtitles specifically with closed captioning because there were so many times i wasnt sure if i didnt hear the dialog or if it was just one of the languages i didnt understand and there were no subtitles they flip flop between languages so often like swedish to english to russian to english to swedish to russian etc that it often just doesnt make sense like people dont do this in real life so whats the point i got later on that maybe there is a point of something subtle changing related to languages but it was a whole lot of language immersion for just that one point to be made there were many times when someone is speaking a language that had no english subtitles just speaking russian or speaking swedish like huh why it seemed mostly pointless or maybe the point was the character in the scene does not understand so you feel that by the lack of subtitles or englishand yet this is a good show that i will keep watching by the end ill know for sure whether it was just poor writing and direction or if there was an actual point in the story as a whole im hoping theres a point for all of this weirdness",2024-02-22,NA

"saltburn (2023)","pretentious garbage","mjw","saltburn directed by emerald fennell who brought us the excellent a promising young woman is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the mazelike world of the english aristocracy but unfortunately it loses its way the film stars barry keoghan as oliver quick a scholarship student at oxford university and jacob elordi as felix catton a charming aristocrat who invites oliver to spend a summer at his familys sprawling estate saltburnsaltburn is set in the mids a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence it attempts to explore the clash of social classes moral vacuity and the seductions of wealth however the films historical and cultural context feels superficial failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time despite being promising the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety the film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness but it doesnt quite hit the mark forced and repetitive dialogues which frequently feel artificial and contrived further weaken the narrativedespite having talented actors portraying them the characters lack depth oliver played by keoghan is a hateful lustful and envious character but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated felix played by elordi is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege but his flimsy compassion does not seem realalthough fennells direction is bold it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life the films pacing is erratic certain scenes seem rushed while others drag on needlessly the movies soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story the movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringingthe cinematography and production design are perhaps the films strongest points the grandeur of saltburn the sprawling estate is captured beautifully and the film does a commendable job of creating a livedin feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time these artistic components however are insufficient to make up for the films weak narrativesaltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little despite its grand setting and talented cast it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters its a film that tries to be a critique of the english aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts while it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal its a film that unfortunately doesnt live up to its potential its not a film id recommend",2023-12-24,NA

"saltburn (2023)","vastly overrated obvious and focused on shock value","brentsbulletinboard","it is  and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford he doesnt fit in with the upperclass atmosphere and has no acquaintances after befriending felix catton a popular and wealthy fellow student however oliver finally seems to find his place at the university invited to the catton family home saltburn for the summer holidays oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods nothing is as it seems though as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase

scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth

first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","killers of my patience","medjasta","the story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the osage nation for their bountiful oil wealth in s oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until martin scorsese decided to make his killers of the flower moon a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold detached and disarrayed but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some leonardo dicaprio is cast jarringly against type as ernest a cowardly quasi wwii vet who is pressured by his amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro into marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock much of the film is distressing in the sense that we the audience know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with ernest and mollie i saw an interview with scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming backstabbing and psychopathic doublecrossing of his urban crime sagas but in a far wilder more rural and spatially wide open locale he further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way and what that might look like onscreen thematically well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled pun intended machine here because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse its in that second part the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here only lily gladstone who undeniably gives the films best performance is really up to the task imbuing mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant angelic poise that is utterly captivating but shes marooned in a tempest of misguided choices missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis ive read the backstory of this film and how scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the fbis eventual involvement they were ultimately sadly too little too late here and towards a deliberate focus on the osage their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil well he doesnt really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages roundtable elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume there is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that if they could see their enemy they would kill them but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them really from a narrative standpoint its pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them mollie especially look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didnt ring true for me she is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by gladstone but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like ernest rife with red flags from the outset i might add is something that scorsese frustratingly sidesteps stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural i cant help but wonder if this story meant to be told from the perspective of the osage may have been better off in other more edgy and esoteric hands",2023-10-19,NA

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a

especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the

although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff

coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

"society of the snow (2023)","stunning technical achievement","evanstondad","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

"society of the snow (2023)","stunning technical achievement","evanstondad","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth

location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

"society of the snow (2023)","stunning technical achievement","evanstondad","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it

us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the

although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff

coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this

can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

"talk to me (i) (2022)","great premise subpar execution","manuelasaez","the premise was what initially drew me to this film although its not that different from similar movies in the genre replacing the ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking and its great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin that being said thats about the only thing about this movie that is worth praisingif youve ever seen a movie about demonic possession spirit conjuring or communicating with the dead via an ouija board youve already seen this film aside from the method being used this has been done plenty of times before and at times i found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie there were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious but they kept it safe and did the basic lets gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead that has already been done to death so many times i wish they would have pushed the envelope going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground its what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the filmthe nail on the coffin was the cast though filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience similar to bodies bodies bodies the cast was a bunch of tryhard teenagers with nasty attitudes poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me im so glad i neither had friends like any of these people and that i never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth i believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast but thats just my personal tasteoverall a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that i didnt regret watching but that i really cant be bothered to recommend aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread the rest of the movie is a retread of every ouija board film youve ever seen where a movie like smile brings something new and original to the genre talk to me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand",2023-09-13,NA

through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our

series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my

lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the

"the pacific (2010)","the pacific is no band of brothers and it shouldnt be","johnmcelroynu","i couldnt tell you how many times i have watched band of brothers i think it is the best production ever made however i resisted watching the pacific my father had five years active duty in the marine corps when i was born and remained on active duty until i was  years old i was ten when he left for viet nam the first time and in high school the next i had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded or killed there i have always felt like marines are family and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see however i finally decided to manup and watch it on veterans day this yeari think bob was a dream come true for the producers they had ironclad characters to follow all the way through and many of the men were still alive and took part in it the story of easy company had been put into book form brilliantly they didnt have that with the pacific the closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men robert leckieeugene sledge and john basilone the three mens paths crossed somebut they did not belong to the same units or know each other although leckie and sledge both knew basilones reputation as brutal and difficult as the war in europe was the pacific war against the japanese was almost incomprehensible except for their time in australia following guadalcanal they were fighting the most brutal fights in history while in the most punishing places on earthit is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under there isnt much in the way of lightheartedness the pacific is not as enjoyable as bob anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained it is a bit more difficult to get into i found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on a little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off i also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days like i did was much better than watching it as it was first presented one episode each week for ten weeksthere were some excellent performances in the pacific someone else singled out ravi maleks portrayal of merriel snafu sheldon as award worthy and i agree  i loved william sadler as ltcol lewis chesty puller and i was also very impressed with tom budge as pfc ronnie gibsonthe three primary characters are portrayed worthily i didnt think joe mazzello as sledge developed his character as well as the other two however i ended up with only nine episodes on my dvr the one i am missing is episode five which i suspect is centered on sledge so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after i see it jon seda gave a fine performance as john basilone which was definitely the roll of a lifetime i think my favorite of the three was james badge dale as bob leckiei wasnt as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many marines being killed and wounded as i expected that was partly because not many of them really looked like marines to me i have always said that you can put an actor in the marine corps uniform but you usually cant make him look like a marine there were a few though who were totally believable including jon seda others have commented on the length of the mens hair as being distracting andor inaccurate by my first memories in the midlate s marines were wearing the crewcuts and flattops that they have worn ever since however i have pictures of my dad in uniform from a decade earlier with longer hair so i think the producers knew what they were doing therealthough i agree with most posters here that the pacific is not as good as bob it is still welldone and definitely worth seeing i think watching it with an open mind and avoiding comparisons it is a good way to approach it one last comment i have is that i wonder why one young marine who was killed on iwo jima at age  was singled out in the tributes at the end i assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed and it was very effective imo but i would be interested to know why they chose the one they did if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man i wont say his name for those who might not have seen it yet but i will always remember it",2011-10-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","the pacific is no band of brothers and it shouldnt be","johnmcelroynu","i couldnt tell you how many times i have watched band of brothers i think it is the best production ever made however i resisted watching the pacific my father had five years active duty in the marine corps when i was born and remained on active duty until i was  years old i was ten when he left for viet nam the first time and in high school the next i had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded or killed there i have always felt like marines are family and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see however i finally decided to manup and watch it on veterans day this yeari think bob was a dream come true for the producers they had ironclad characters to follow all the way through and many of the men were still alive and took part in it the story of easy company had been put into book form brilliantly they didnt have that with the pacific the closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men robert leckieeugene sledge and john basilone the three mens paths crossed somebut they did not belong to the same units or know each other although leckie and sledge both knew basilones reputation as brutal and difficult as the war in europe was the pacific war against the japanese was almost incomprehensible except for their time in australia following guadalcanal they were fighting the most brutal fights in history while in the most punishing places on earthit is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under there isnt much in the way of lightheartedness the pacific is not as enjoyable as bob anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained it is a bit more difficult to get into i found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on a little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off i also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days like i did was much better than watching it as it was first presented one episode each week for ten weeksthere were some excellent performances in the pacific someone else singled out ravi maleks portrayal of merriel snafu sheldon as award worthy and i agree  i loved william sadler as ltcol lewis chesty puller and i was also very impressed with tom budge as pfc ronnie gibsonthe three primary characters are portrayed worthily i didnt think joe mazzello as sledge developed his character as well as the other two however i ended up with only nine episodes on my dvr the one i am missing is episode five which i suspect is centered on sledge so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after i see it jon seda gave a fine performance as john basilone which was definitely the roll of a lifetime i think my favorite of the three was james badge dale as bob leckiei wasnt as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many marines being killed and wounded as i expected that was partly because not many of them really looked like marines to me i have always said that you can put an actor in the marine corps uniform but you usually cant make him look like a marine there were a few though who were totally believable including jon seda others have commented on the length of the mens hair as being distracting andor inaccurate by my first memories in the midlate s marines were wearing the crewcuts and flattops that they have worn ever since however i have pictures of my dad in uniform from a decade earlier with longer hair so i think the producers knew what they were doing therealthough i agree with most posters here that the pacific is not as good as bob it is still welldone and definitely worth seeing i think watching it with an open mind and avoiding comparisons it is a good way to approach it one last comment i have is that i wonder why one young marine who was killed on iwo jima at age  was singled out in the tributes at the end i assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed and it was very effective imo but i would be interested to know why they chose the one they did if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man i wont say his name for those who might not have seen it yet but i will always remember it",2011-10-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you will be moved you will laugh you will cry as long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it",2010-05-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you

"the godfather (1972)","an iconic film","alexkolokotronis","there is very little that i can add to the reviews on here that have explained what is so wonderful about the godfather so well i have seen many amazing movies as well as some clunkers but the godfather was beyond amazing there are so many images details and scenes that i seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago the godfather is so incredibly wellmade and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films ive seen so much so i couldnt think of a single flaw and i am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why i didnt see this film before nowtrue the godfather is a little slowmoving and the plot takes a while to unfold but neither of these are flaws as such the slow pacing added to the elegiac quality the godfather has and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you being  i was worried whether i was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it but luckily i understood it perfectly and i can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to bethe godfather for one thing looks stunning i strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film in some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen autumnal and very picturesque it is not just the cinematography that makes the godfather look stunning the costumes are beautifully tailored the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculatethen there is the score by nina rota one word outstanding i have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for the godfather this score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from francis ford coppola and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent thoughtprovoking and darkly humorous as for the violence some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop and i almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horses head in his bed but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of itthe acting is absolutely fantastic bringing to life characters that are rich and complex perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them and i have to say the godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance in particular marlon brando is brilliant as don vito very heavily disguised yet stately every word of dialogue every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged al pacinos casting was admittedly risky but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film while james caan is dignified and loyal diane keaton beautiful and alluring and robert duvall nicely understatedin conclusion absolutely amazing and i can see completely why it is considered one of the  greatest movies ever made it is that good in fact my year old brother loved it so much he wants to see it again  though this film is too good for that rating bethany cox",2002-03-05,NA
"the godfather (1972)","another kind of family movie","bah tnt","the godfather is quite simply a masterful piece of filmmaking an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot made with finesse style to spare and a director who elicits pitchperfect performances from a talented cast this is moviemaking as it should beyes its a very long film and yes some sections are quite slow nevertheless none of the film is any less than riveting the story  of a fatherson takeover in one of new yorks major italian mafia families  is fairly straight forward and yet francis ford coppola turns it into something else so much more a meditation on the human condition perhapscertainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity jealousy betrayal anger and revenge are all key themes here and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence and im glad coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happenmarlon brando takes the showrunner role here the patriarch whos past his prime but its easy to spot the real star of the piece al pacino who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity robert duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part but watch out for james caan whose volatile sonny is one of the films most engaging characters altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of filmmaking which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare but the godfather towers head and shoulders above them all",2013-03-30,NA

"the godfather (1972)","initially i wasnt a fan but then i realised","mattrochman","the acting was simply amazing what else could you say what could be more appealing to peopleeven today than watching actors like al pacino marlon brando james caan diane keaton talia shire and robert duvall this is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies with this movie brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight his performance as the godfather alone is iconic his character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich his performance though was not a clich his performance was subtle and breathtaking it was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than marlon brando himself al pacino was perfect for this film as well what a way to start up your career his character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly he was able to display his own innerbattles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family friends and enemies his character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me robert duvall to me was the glue to the movie he added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not italian yet having the respect of the mafia his character is a man of high authority within the corleone family who was listened to and insightful this was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout the rest of the cast was just icing on the cakethe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking as mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this it is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect it is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene there are countless symbols messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get",2014-04-01,NA

"lisa frankenstien","this should have been rrated","kjproulx","this is one of the oddest experiences ive had at the movies in a while lisa frankenstein is a film where the idea seemed fun the people involved have made things ive enjoyed in the past and the cast seemed to be having a great time so what went wrong for me well i think it all comes down to the fact that this movie is trying to be accessible to a wide age spectrum but that made the movie lose a bit of its charm this is easily a script that shouldve taken it one step further and been rated r many films have done similar premises to this one in the past and while i wont say they were all better in concept the final products say otherwise let me explain myselftaking place in  lisa kathryn newton a teenager with a few questionable traits wishes to be with someone who is dead and she has never met his corpse is reanimated after she wishes upon his grave and a mysterious storm hits from here even though he cant speak they become close and kind of psychotic this very quickly becomes a twisted and messed up movie but under the pg banner it just felt watered down there are multiple instances when limbs are chopped off or people are murdered and while it all is done in the spirit of having a good weird time at the movies it lacks the visuals of everything that was going onkathryn newton is quite enjoyable as lisa and i wish the film had better dialogue for her because even though there is some clever writing and she made me laugh quite often she is a much darker character than the pg rating allowed her to be cole sprouse in my opinion has honestly never been better though he has no lines but that made for some great physical acting for a character without dialogue he held his own against newton here carla gugino plays lisas stepmother and where that story leads is easily the highlight of the film but again every great idea this film had just felt watered down i feel like a broken record talking about this one simply because i think this had all the bones of a great fun weird movie there is also one scene in particular where i was laughing because i couldnt believe what i was watching but the movie couldnt go far enough to show it actually happening that was the majority of my experience here even though the film was clever enough to be mildly enjoyable as it islook zelda williams does a solid job at directing here diablo codys script is sharp but does add the extra flare that was needed i liked every performance and it absolutely felt like it was from the ss everyone did a very solid job bringing this screenplay to life everything about this movie from the set design to the bright visual aesthetic all worked for me and should be commended i just cant wrap my head around why this one wasnt rated r especially considering certain things that happen or are implied here its a headscratcher for me i still had a good time though and i feel that the crowd that will like this one the most are teenagers in high school who get the humour otherwise its okay but it had so much potential",2024-03-07,NA

"ferrari","ironically slow given the subject matter","cdjh","ferrari ends up being such a slog of a movie in place of what shouldve been a thrilling an interesting portrait of a complex figure the performances might be solid and theres an effective moment here or there but the word that comes to mind when describing the film as a whole is flat this filmmaker and cast telling a story with this interesting a subject matter shouldve amounted to a lot more than it ultimately did for as exhilarating as motor racing is supposed to be i have to say i found the film to be overwhelmingly dull when all was said and donethe whole aesthetic is totally without life which is the last thing i wouldve expected for a director of michael manns calibre mann takes a very documentarian approach to the directing and it just robs the film of any energy or sense of direction from almost the opening minutes there a serious lack of momentum the scenes play out in very beat for beat type way with no sense of flair and as impressive as the racing sequences are theyre too few and far between to save this movie from the drag that it ends up being all the scenes away from the track are framed in the most shotreverse shot manner imaginable so almost none of the dramatic moments had any sort of impact on me theres an extremely effective moment in the rd act that felt like mann was finally adding some stakes to the whole thing by then it was too little too late for methe script here is painfully unremarkable and it rears its head in how it portrays its main character adam driver is solid in the role as enzo ferrari though i wouldnt rate it as one of his best performances but i never really found the depiction of the character to be that compelling its established early on that ferrari puts up a wall around everyone but as an audience member it put me at a distance from his character i didnt think there were enough moments where his guard went down and we see what really drives him so as a result i just found him to be a bit of a rich egomaniac with motivations i didnt find to be that interesting theres a love triangle thats set up with penelope cruz and shailene woodleys characters that almost felt like it shouldve been the scripts main focus but after a while it just fades into the background for the central race to take up more screen time driver and cruz have good chemistry but i never really thought that mann got to the heart of their relationship and the exposition thats given on this three way dynamic feels like it comes in the complete wrong order i was just waiting for characters to find out information i already knew and it just kills the pacing and any impact that these reveals couldve hadi never wouldve guessed that ferrari was a long time passion project for michael mann because nothing in the final product gives any sense of a vision for this story its totally unimpressive on a script and technical level and the few effective moments and impressive race sequences arent enough to save the total bore that ferrari ended up being as a whole",2024-02-11,NA

"ferrari","a lot of missed potential","ruelshepperd","in the surface ferrari appears to be a welldirected wellacted and adrenaline fuelled with excellent racing sequences and yet throughout the film i couldnt help but feel disinterested and dissatisfied this film has all the elements to be a slam dunk and yet i never felt attached to enzo ferrari and his strugglesthe performances are decent overall unfortunately i was most disappointed by adam driver as the titular character he never showcases the great range that i know he is capable with his enzo ferrari is very reserved and somewhat bland its not helped that he is speaking english while attempting an italian accent if chernobyl  can get away with all english dialogue then i feel you can do that here it would certainly allow driver to reach greater levels of acting the saviour of this film is certainly penlope cruz she delivers an excellent performance as laura and i wish she got more screen timebut if youre here for the racing the film does delivers its few and far between but the third act is a long intense race with great sound design and editing its a shame that youre not invested in any of the racers since the film doesnt characterise any of them it means the climax of the film doesnt hit as hard as it probably should its certainly shocking and brutal but its hard to stay immersed when the violence is so over the top and the cgi is not quite greatoverall ferrari feels like a film that couldve been better the characters couldve been better the story couldve covered a more interesting part of enzo ferraris life and the acting couldve been more i left this film not feeling like i did not know enzo ferrari its a film that perhaps is not for me but i can see how others enjoy it",2023-12-26,NA
"ferrari","nice to have michael mann back","masonsaul","there are a couple films that come to mind when trying to judge how good ferrari was the first is napoleon it is another biography that came out around the same time as this film each film needs the main character to capture the audiences interest for both films the dysfunctional marital relationship was a major narrative because of joaquin phoenixs legacy of gripping roles joker he successfully embodied the main character the film suffered for other reasons but it kept my interest ferrari cast adam driver as the main character i first saw driver in midnight special as a quirky and interesting scientist i really like driver and thought he was a good fit as the bad guy in the new star wars movies however i think someone else would have been a better fit as ferrari driver doesnt exude power and leadership like the role needed someone who is bit older and more fits the physique if this was made  years ago someone like christian bale wouldve been a good fitthe other film i cant help but compare ferrari to is ford vs ferrari although it came out four years prior to this film it is recent enough to gauge what is a better film about racing ferrari never pretended to be about racing it is a biography of the man meanwhile ford vs ferrari is about racing the movie centered more on the cars than the people in ferrari care is taken to give many of the supporting characters some depth the downside is that the majority of the film focuses more on the people than the machines for that reason i preferred ford vs ferrari in truth that film features very little of ferrari other than being the rival for fordon the flipside the driving scenes in the ferrari are very dynamic without being gimmicky and are a feast of sight and sound the cinematography does a good job showing us vintage italy the dialogue could be cringeworthy if one cared to scrutinize the italian accents in general when rating this micheal mann film i thought of public enemies that film follows john dillinger but has a different tone than this sadly the tone here is very mild for ferrari and the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts this is mostly evident in the climax in which no swelling of emotion takes place at least not as intended i give it a  out of ",2023-12-19,NA
"ferrari","i was expecting more","vengeance","its  and enzo ferrari as portrayed by adam driver has a lot on his mind his wife penelope cruz is mad with grief over the death of their son his mistress shailene woodley wants him to acknowledge their son so he can be confirmed hes hired a new driver after the last one got himself killed and hes distracted by his moviestar girlfriend and his accountant informs him he is broke and he needs to get a wealthy corporate partner which he can only do if one of his cars wins the thousandmile mille miglia also orsi over at maserati is in precisely the same position and seems to have a better team of racersmichael mann is not known for character studies his subject is the glitzy world and its seamy side so this movie about ferrari is a natural fit the script makes it clear what his multitudinous problems are and they keep increasing throughout the movie while adam driver lets down his guard with no one one and miss cruz gets to have the emotional fireworks i am not fond of movies about racing since most of the character development seems to consist of men in car moving gear controls and the audio engineer choosing vroomvroom sounds from their audio libraries however this movie makes clear that ferraris one real passion is racing cars and its a series of real crises that he has to overcome considering the negligible story content of so many of this years for your consideration titles ill say that its easily worth your time in the theater seat",2024-01-10,NA

"ferrari","everyone versus ferrari","boblipton","saw this at the  filmfestival ghant belgium obviously the main topic is cars and car races but there is also a mixture of family drama illegitimate son versus son of current wife who thus gave him an alternative heir woman with money prepared to invest and so on to make it compatible for family viewing actually you can consider it two films nicely intermixed with another the car race fans will find plenty to watch and the rest of the film moves the family story forward implicitly we know that the story ends well this is no spoiler given that the name ferrari still exists as a car brandnice details in abundance drivers can have girlfriends who either distract or stimulate when drivers bring their girlfriends along the press tends to ignore the cars and focus on the women to the dismay of ferrari he asks a journalist to bring a rumor in the world letting him also mention in the same article that he firmly denies it playing the cards for a business deal and there is his wife with independent means and lots of money to spare who has her own set of requirements when willing to invest in the companyall in all i did not regret booking tickets although i feared beforehand that car races would be the main course on the menu my fears were unjustified there is ample family and relational drama to keep everyones attention and the car races do not distract but enhance the experience",2023-12-18,NA
